    <h2>PREFACE</h2>
</div>


<p>More than fifty years after the organization of the
Thirty-ninth Regiment and its departure for the seat of
war, its printed history makes its appearance. The long
delay has not arisen from any lack of desire for its preparation,
nor on account of want of material. For many
long years it was supposed that the recital was in preparation,
but the comrade to whom the task was intrusted
went away into the other world before its completion,
and survivors of the Regiment began to wonder if their
story of long marches, fierce fighting and unspeakable
suffering in Rebel prisons ever would be told. At the
annual reunion of the Veteran Association in 1911 it was
voted to proceed with the long cherished proposition, and
a committee was appointed to carry out the proposal;
after two years and a half the survivors of that committee
present this volume to the patient waiters among the living
veterans and to the families and descendants of those
who have made the final crossing.</p>

<p>Readers of the book should bear in mind that it is very
far from being a history of the war, nor does it discuss
campaigns and battles in their entirety; on the contrary
every effort has been made to describe the part borne by
the Regiment in said campaigns and engagements. Long
shelves in the large libraries of the country are already
laden with great volumes descriptive of the War of the
Rebellion as a whole and of detached portions thereof;
as many more have been written of eminent individual
experience, like the recollections of Grant, Sherman,
Sheridan on the Union side and of Beauregard, Johnston
and Longstreet among the Confederates, but the story of
the great struggle will not be fully told until that of every
regiment finds its way into print. Regimental histories<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
occupy a golden mean between the comprehensiveness of the
general history and the minuteness of individual records.</p>

<p>Massachusetts veterans can not be too grateful that
the Commonwealth in its wisdom, a number of years ago,
offered to assist in the preparation and publication of
regimental histories by the purchase of five hundred copies
of the same, under certain conditions of size and contents.
In this manner and otherwise, more than one-half of the
organizations of the Bay State which participated in the
effort to maintain the Union have been written and it is
hoped that the generosity of the Commonwealth and the
courage of the veterans will continue until every regiment,
battery and battalion will have been adequately described.
While those who made the history are rapidly passing
over the divide 'twixt life and death, and personal recollections
are more difficult to obtain, yet their stories are
not written so much, at this late date, from word of mouth
as from letters, diaries and jottings made at the time and
now are carefully preserved either by the writers or those
to whom they have passed as precious legacies.</p>

<p>A history like this of the Thirty-ninth represents many
letters written to veterans or to their surviving families
in the effort to secure for transcription whatever note the
soldier may have made in camp, field or prison-pen, bearing
on the period in which the writer wore the blue. In
several cases, through fear of losing the precious documents,
friends of deceased soldiers have declined to lend
them for use; of course it is too late to secure them for
utility in this instance but, for the sake of other efforts in
this direction, let us hope that those people possessing any
written observations on the trying times of 1861-'65
will freely proffer their employment by those interested
in their permanent preservation. It is a lamentable fact
that many papers prepared under the fire of the enemy or, at
least, in that indefinite region known as the "Front," have
disappeared through the extra diligence of careful housekeepers
and the general dislike of "old things lying 'round."</p>

<p>While many months in the earlier portions of the service<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
of the Thirty-ninth were devoted to drill and thorough
preparation, including a prolonged stay in the city of
Washington, yet the call to the field, soon after Gettysburg,
was so obeyed that before the seal of Appomattox was
set upon the fate of the Confederacy, Colonel Davis' men
had proved beyond any chance for cavil that they were
of the same stuff that had rallied so readily at Concord
and Lexington; had bled in the streets of Baltimore and,
on the decks of the Constitution and the Monitor, had
shown the world what was meant by resistance to tyranny.
Its first officer was killed at the front; the third mortally
wounded, and the second so severely injured that his life
was long despaired of and seemingly was saved as by a
miracle. At the Weldon R. R., on the 19th of August,
1864, so completely was the Regiment swept off the field,
through no fault of its own, its organization was nearly
lost, and the deaths in the prisons of the South of these
victims exceeded those of all other Massachusetts Infantry
Regiments with a single exception.</p>

<p>In seeking printed data for condensation in this narrative
the committee was rewarded in finding in the Fourth
Volume of the Printed Papers of the Massachusetts
Military Historical Society a very clear and interesting
description of the "Operations of the Army of the Potomac,
May 7-11, 1864" by Brevet Brigadier-General Charles
Lawrence Peirson, the universally loved and respected
Colonel of the Thirty-ninth, and from his observations
liberal abstracts have been made for the edification of
readers of this history. In the same volume also are
found papers by Captain Charles H. Porter, Companies
D and A of the Regiment, and always so active in the
councils of the Veteran Association, who discusses the
"Opening of the Campaign of 1864" and the "Battle
of Cold Harbor," valuable in considering the parts taken
in those incidents by the Regiment in which he served.
Access also has been had to typewritten papers on the
part borne by the Fifth Corps in the last three days of
March, '65, and "The Fifth Corps at Five Forks" also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
prepared by Captain Porter and which have proved of
great utility in this compilation.</p>

<p>Naturally, the papers of General Peirson and Captain
Porter are of a general character, somewhat removed from
the individual, but quite the reverse is found in the well
preserved accounts of company experience as presented
in contributions to the Woburn Journal by Albert P.
Barrett of Co. K, to the Medford Mercury by John S.
Beck of "C" and in the monograph of Lieut. John H.
Dusseault of Company E. Unfortunately, the spirited
story, as told by the Woburn scribe, goes no further than
the Mine Run campaign, leaving the reader longing for a
continuation of his glowing recital; Diarist Beck returns
his comrades, those who survived, to their home-town,
while the Somerville chronicler, whose observations are
clear and instructive up to the date of his wound and
consequent invalidism is compelled to end his direct
comments on that direful August day of '64 at the Weldon
R. R. However, whether general or specific, extended or
condensed, the readers of the history owe much to the
careful annalist of those trying days of the early sixties.</p>

<p>Thanks are due the survivors who by their answers to
circular letters rendered possible the exceedingly full
roster, wherein are found the individual records whence
must be drawn in coming years the facts for those seeking
admission to patriotic organizations on the strength of
ancestral service in preserving the Union. It is a source
of regret that data could not be obtained for extending
the descriptive list of every name in the Regiment. Especially
are thanks due to General Peirson for his unflagging
interest in the work of preparation and for his generosity
in helping on the undertaking. The committee representing
the Veteran Association is entitled to the thanks
of all concerned for its careful attention to details, for the
time given to rehearsals of the story as it progressed and
for its unfailing willingness and promptness in assisting
in every possible manner. At the same time it is impossible
to suppress the regrets that inevitably rise over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
seemingly untimely deaths of comrades Brown and
Whittaker. Possibly no one had been more prominent
than the first named in laying out the work and securing
data for the story, but he was called away in the very
midst of the preparation; Comrade Whittaker entered
into the scheme with all the zeal and ardor so characteristic
of his intense nature, and died, as it were, pen in
hand, inditing the story of the terrible opening of The
Battle Summer as he remembered it.</p>

<p>Thanks also should be rendered to the Brothers Mentzer
and Mitchell of "A" for anecdotes and incidents; to Geo.
V. Shedd and Edward H. Lewis of "B" for the use of their
diaries; to the family of the late John S. Beck of "C" for
the loan of his well preserved diary, and to M. F. Roberts
for other Company C facts; to the widow of Captain C.
H. Porter, "D" and "A," for the use of his scrapbook,
manuscripts and other data; to Lieut. J. H. Dusseault,
"E," for his accurate and interesting account of the
Somerville Company; to the family of John E. Horton
for his painstaking diary; and to Ex-mayor Edward
Glines, Somerville, for the use of the carefully kept diary
of his brother Frederick A.; to Lieut. Jas. E. Seaver,
secretary of the Old Colony Historical Society, Taunton,
for valuable data concerning Company F, its officers and
men; to Lieut. Chas. H. Chapman and Sergt. J. H. Prouty,
"G," for facts concerning that company; to George Monk,
"H," for his brother Robert's diary; to Lieut. H. F. Felch,
W. H. Garfield and the Hon. H. C. Mulligan, son of Lieut.
Simon Mulligan, for facts pertaining to Company I; and
to the family of A. P. Barrett, "K," for the scrapbook
having his letters to the Woburn Journal; George E. Fowle,
Abijah Thompson and Capt. E. F. Wyer (Fifth M. V. M.)
for Company K data and incidents; to all those whose
journals and recollections rendered possible the unexcelled
accounts of prison experiences. Finally, all concerned
unite in thanks to the ever efficient and courteous corps
of officers and assistants in the office of the adjutant-general
at the State House for favors there extended.</p>

<div class="chapter">
    <h2>IN THE BEGINNING</h2>
</div>


<p>While patriotism never flagged for a moment, and the
determination to maintain the Union at all hazards was
still as strong as ever, it must be confessed that the midsummer
military outlook in 1862 was not altogether inspiring
for the Nation. Whatever hopes had been raised
by the success of Burnside in North Carolina, by Grant's
campaign in Tennessee, and through the occupation of
New Orleans by the combined forces of Butler and Farragut,
they had been more than offset by the failure of
McClellan's efforts on the peninsula and the unfruitful
outcome of Halleck's movement against Corinth. An
army that had displayed prodigies of valor from Fair Oaks
to Malvern Hill, now catching its breath on the banks of
the James River, and an enemy leisurely departing from
the depot which Halleck had thought thoroughly invested,
were bitter morsels for Northern people who had been
led to expect the capture of Richmond and a like fate for
the rebel forces which had fallen back from Shiloh.</p>

<p>The slopes of Malvern were still red with the blood of
fallen heroes when President Lincoln, on the 4th of July,
1862, startled the nation with a call for three hundred
thousand additional troops. The land was rapidly becoming
one vast armed camp; Massachusetts already had
sent nearly or quite fifty thousand men into the army and
navy, out of her population of less than one and a half
million people, but before the year was done, the aggregate
was swollen to more than eighty thousand. Out of the
great number called for, the assignment to Massachusetts
was fifteen thousand and, on the seventh of the month, Governor
Andrew formally presented the demand to the people
of the Commonwealth. Hitherto, there had been no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
regular apportionment, each division of the state having
been ready and anxious to aid in filling whatever quota
might be required. In this case there was a clear statement
of what each city and town, from Abington to
Yarmouth would be expected to do.</p>

<p>Concerning the number called for, the president in a
private telegram to Governor Morgan of New York said,
"It was thought safest to mark high enough. I should not
want the half of 300,000 new troops if I could have them
now. If I had 50,000 additional troops here now, I
believe I could substantially close the war in two weeks.
But time is everything; and if I get 50,000 new men in a
month I shall have lost 20,000 old ones during the same
month, having gained only 30,000 with the difference
between old and new troops still against me. The quicker
you send, the less you will have to send. Time is everything,
please act in view of this." All this time, it must be remembered,
Governor Andrew, in a mild way, was criticising the
National Administration for its failure to liberate the slaves
and for not imposing upon them many of the hardships
borne by the regularly enlisted men.</p>

<p>Nor were the needs of the Government satisfied with the
demand of July 4th, however large it may have seemed,
for, while the entire loyal North was putting forth every
possible effort to secure the required enlistments there
came from Washington, on the 4th of August, another call
for troops, this time also demanding three hundred thousand
men, just as though there were a never-ending source
of supply. This call was accompanied by the possibility
of a draft, that most dreaded of all methods for securing
reinforcements, provided the volunteers did not appear
within a certain limited period; the apportionment, 19,080
men, it will be observed was more than a fourth larger
than that in the preceding call, an excess explained on the
basis that the total number, 34,080, bore the same proportion
to the 600,000, the sum of the two calls, that the free
population of Massachusetts did to the free population<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
in the states that had shown themselves loyal to the Union,
and were supporting the Government in the struggle.</p>

<p>A very prominent question in the emergency was just
how should the newly enlisted men be placed; should they
be added to regiments already in the field or should new
organizations be made for their reception? Excellent
arguments were offered on both sides; the question had
been discussed from the very moment that battles or disease
had begun making gaps in the ranks. When Mayor
Isaac Davis, after the disastrous engagement of Ball's
Bluff, telegraphed to Colonel Charles Devens, of the
Fifteenth Massachusetts Infantry, asking what Worcester
could do for the regiment, the subsequently distinguished
officer replied, "Send us three hundred and ten men to
fill our gaps; also a blanket and a pair of mittens for each
of us; that will do for the present." The good mayor found
it much easier to supply the woolen requirements than the
men, who, for certain reasons, were unwilling to enter an
old regiment where promotion would inevitably go to those
who had been in the ranks longest, and soldiering without
the possibilities of promotion is dull business.</p>

<p>Those who have considered carefully the subject of war,
its progress and development, have, in many cases, taken
occasion to censure some of the Northern States, and especially
Massachusetts, forgetful of the fact that local feelings
and a confidence in leaders whom the men know go a long
way in imparting confidence to the citizen soldier. Governor
John A. Andrew would have filled the old regiments, rather
than form new ones, and to the newly formed organizations
he would have given experienced officers instead of those
elected by the men, but the latter would not have it so.
In this connection that great man is said to have exclaimed,
"Julius Caesar himself couldn't raise a company for an
old regiment as long as there is a shoemaker left to make
a captain of." The town system, so prominent a feature
in New England life, had much to do with the fellow-feeling
in companies and when these different companies, repre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>senting
as many townships, all belonged to the same county,
seemingly little was left to be desired in the background of
the organization.</p>

<p>The numbering of Massachusetts Infantry organizations
had already mounted to thirty before the call of the President
in July, 1862. Recruiting was very active, notwithstanding
the horrors of war, so graphically set forth in the
daily press. Meetings to stimulate enlistments were held
throughout the Commonwealth, becoming a daily occurrence
in the City of Boston, where her historic buildings and
public places resounded with eloquence in behalf of the
Union and its preservation. Points of rendezvous were
provided at Pittsfield, Worcester, Lynnfield, Readville,
and other places for regiments, while Camp Cameron at
North Cambridge was reserved for recruits to the older
organizations. Within two months from the issuing of
Governor Andrew's Order Number 26<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a>, dated July 7th,
more than four thousand men had been enlisted and sent
forward to old regiments, nine new ones had been raised
and equipped, and eight of them had been sent forward to
strengthen the hands of the Government. So diligently
had the governor and his assistants labored, the dreaded
draft was averted and, long before the first snowfall, the
last of the great demand upon Massachusetts for the sons
whom she had reared for other purposes, had gone southward,
gun in hand, following the flag.</p>

<p>Sometimes regiments were raised by officers commissioned
for this purpose; in other cases companies were raised in
cities or large towns which, when full, were sent forward to
the nearest rendezvous and, when a sufficient number had
been thus assembled, the regimental organization followed.
Many towns could not furnish men enough for a company,
so the men went forward in squads or individually and these
recruits either pieced out some company, not quite filled,
or were thrown together to constitute a new company, this


<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>

being the case with Company G of the Thirty-ninth, which
had no central source like those of the others. Lynnfield
had been designated as the point to which should be sent
all Eastern Massachusetts volunteers for new regiments,
while to North Cambridge, Camp Cameron, were forwarded
the men who had enlisted in old organizations. These
two points were to receive the three years' soldiers from the
counties of Barnstable, Bristol, Dukes, Essex, Middlesex,
Nantucket, Norfolk, Plymouth and Suffolk. Already in
Camp Edwin M. Stanton, Lynnfield, usually called Camp
Stanton, were the Thirty-fifth and the Thirty-eighth Regiments
in process of formation and along with the Thirty-ninth
in reporting there was the Fortieth; later came the
Forty-first, the last of the three years' regiments under the
July call.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter">
    <h2>LYNNFIELD</h2>
</div>


<p>Several of the companies constituting the Thirty-ninth,
had left their respective towns under the belief that they
were to join the Thirty-fifth, but that organization and
also the Thirty-eighth were so far completed, that the
numerals "39" became the designation of the regiment,
whose story is progressing here. Lynnfield had been a
rendezvous, already, for the Seventeenth, Nineteenth,
Twenty-second and Twenty-third regiments and, however
satisfactory it may have proved for those bodies, it was
clearly inadequate to the demands of the several thousand
men to congregate here during July and August. Placed
on a branch railroad, it was difficult of access and did not
have space for the formation of a regimental line; so rapidly
did the volunteers report, they found only scant comforts
in their rendezvous. While only thirteen miles from Boston
and being nearer still to Lynn, the rush of recruits to the
rendezvous sadly tried the resources of the commissary,
and made many a boy wish he were elsewhere. Says one
observer, "No preparation had been made for our reception;
finally however, tents were found for a portion of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
company and we passed the first night in camp in anything
but a peaceful frame of mind or body. Quite a number of
the men left camp for home, or found quarters elsewhere.
Rations, too, were conspicuously absent and for a time we
depended on outside sources for our supply." Time, and
patience however, relieved many of these distresses. The
companies as they reached camp were known only by the
name of the town whence they came, or that of the officer
who was in command. Their designation by letters of
the alphabet came later. Herewith follows a brief account
of the several companies, their respective beginnings, their
organization and time of reporting at Camp Stanton.</p>

<p class="ph3"><span class="smcap">South Danvers</span>, since 1868 <span class="smcap">Peabody</span>.</p>


<p>The allotment of this town on account of the call for
troops was seventy-five. An enthusiastic meeting was held
July 11, in the Town Hall, over which B. C. Perkins presided
and at which the Rev. Mr. Barber and others spoke.
A committee on resolutions was appointed consisting of
Messrs. F. Poole, Lewis Allen, John D. Poore, Alfred McKenzie
and Dr. George Osborne. A committee of nine
members was also appointed who were to assist or supervise
enlistments. On the 21st, the anniversary of the Battle
of Bull Run, a special town meeting was held at which it
was voted to pay one hundred and fifty dollars' bounty
to each volunteer. Speeches were numerous and a committee
of forty citizens was appointed, five for each school district,
to co-operate with that of nine men already in existence.
One-fourth of the quota had been raised in two
days. It was voted to borrow twelve thousand dollars,
and a committee was appointed to secure the money on
time at six per cent.; on the 25th, Friday, a great open air
meeting was held in the town square, a platform having
been erected in front of the Warren Bank Building. Isaac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
Hardy presided and spoke as did others. On the next day,
Saturday, the recruits, accompanied by about one hundred
citizens, under the direction of Roberts S. Daniels, Jr.,
and having a brass band, marched from the recruiting
station to Lynnfield, distant several miles away, an exacting
experience for raw recruits on a hot July day. Among
those witnessing the departure was one who, fifty years
before, had been a prisoner in Dartmoor. All of these
newly enlisted men supposed that they were going into
the Thirty-fifth Regiment. July 31st, an adjourned town-meeting
was held in which it was announced that Eben
Sutton, a public spirited citizen, had volunteered to take
the entire loan at five and one half per cent., an act that
was greeted with great applause by all present. Captain,

<p>Recruiting began early in Roxbury and on the 10th,
there was a special meeting of both branches of the City
Government, at which it was voted to give seventy-five
dollars to each recruit in addition to whatever the General
Government might offer. It was also voted to appropriate
thirty thousand dollars for expenses, and the treasurer was
directed to borrow. Roxbury's quota was three hundred
and eighty-nine; Saturday night, to inspirit enlistments,
a public meeting was held in Institute Hall at which Mayor
William Gaston (subsequently governor) presided and numerous
and eloquent speeches were made, and the previous
action of the City Government was publicly endorsed. July
17th, the bounty was raised to one hundred dollars, and on
the 19th a brass band concert was given in front of Institute
Hall, with an address by the Hon. John C. Park. August
7, the Company, numbering sixty-nine men, under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
command of Captain Graham, escorted by the militia of
the city, paraded and all were entertained by Colonel Hodges
of the Horse Guards in Bacon's Hall, where Judge Russell
spoke. Sunday, the 10th, the Company attended service in
the first Universalist Church; on the 11th, again escorted
by the Horse Guards, the Company paraded through the
principal streets to Bacon's Hall where speeches were made
by several persons, including Private George F. Moses, of
the Company, the latter being filled to its maximum. It
was on the 15th of August that the Company assembled and
through lines of friends and relatives, at a little before noon,
started for Boston, whence it took train for Lynnfield,
arriving at about three o'clock, p. m. Captain, William

<p class="ph3"><span class="smcap">Medford.</span></p>


<p>Medford's popular company, the Lawrence Light Guard,
had already distinguished itself in the Fifth M. V. M., under
the first call for troops, and was enjoying something akin
to dignified ease when the president's call for three hundred
thousand men placed new responsibilities upon all the cities
and towns, Medford having to raise eighty-eight men as
her quota. Though the selectmen, acting under the governor's
orders, did their best as recruiting officers, and though
there was an offer of seventy-five dollars' bounty, voted by
the town, and though on the 21st of July the offer was increased
to one hundred dollars, the eligible men did not seem
disposed to enlist until, on the 29th of the month, the selectmen
addressed a letter to the Light Guard, asking its members
to step to the front and assist in filling the requisition.
The request was complied with at once and, on the 14th of
August, the company was complete with its complement
of one hundred and one men, including many who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
served under the earlier demand. Mustered in on the 14th,
it left Medford for Lynnfield on the 25th of August under
most auspicious circumstances, these including religious
exercises, speeches and the presence of thousands of sympathetic
people. The commissioned officers, all of whom
had been out with Colonel Lawrence, were captain, John
Hutchins; first lieutenant, Perry Coleman; second lieutenant,
Isaac F. R. Hosea.</p>

    <h2>COMPANY D.</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3"><span class="smcap">Quincy.</span></p>


<p>The quota of Quincy was one hundred and five men;
and to secure this number of new soldiers the first meeting
was held in the Town Hall, July 12th; a special one, called
by the selectmen, and the crowd was so great that the hall
would not hold it. Chief Justice Bigelow, presided and
spoke, being followed by Josiah Quincy, Jr., John Quincy
Adams and others; it was voted to offer a bounty of
seventy-five dollars, and patriotic resolutions were adopted.
At a meeting held July 21st, it was voted to raise the bounty
to one hundred and twenty-five dollars. The third meeting
was held July 29th, with William S. Morton presiding;
addresses were made by Lieut. Colonel Henry Walker of
Quincy, Lieut. Colonel Guiney of the Ninth Regiment,
and by one of the recruits, Charles H. Porter, son of Whitcomb
Porter, whose remarks were of a very enthusiastic
character, Captain Spear receiving numerous compliments.
By the 2nd of August, ninety-six men had been secured,
the recruiting being done by a town committee. Monday,
the 4th of August, "Good-bye" was said to the Company;
line was formed at the Town Hall under escort of Niagara
Hose Company, Captain Newcomb; an address was given
by Lieut. Colonel Walker, and a collation was served in
Lyceum Hall. Thence by horse cars, accompanied by the
firemen and a band, the soldiers went to and through Bos<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>ton,
and so on by steam to Lynnfield, reaching that place
at about two p. m. There had been one hundred and
twelve enlistments in the company, but some had been
rejected. On the 22nd, the town generously voted to pay
the recruits one dollar per day for the time spent in drilling.
This same day the company came home on a furlough, and
on the next night, that of Saturday, the men assembled
in the Town Hall and presented Captain Spear with a
sword, costing fifty dollars, and to First Sergeant John
Nichols, a sash and belt. It was a noisily enthusiastic
meeting, so much so that very little of the speaking could
be heard. Sunday, the 24th, beheld a part of the Company
at service in the Universalist Church in the morning and,
in the afternoon, Lieutenant McLaughlin, U. S. A., came
out from Boston and mustered the Company into the
United States service. Monday, the 25th, the men returned
to camp, all save three, who were apprehended as deserters
and sent after their fellows, everyone proving himself a
good soldier afterwards; they were just a trifle dilatory in
keeping up. Captain, Edward A. Spear; first lieutenant,
William G. Sheen; second lieutenant, Charles H. Porter.</p>

    <h2>COMPANY E.</h2>

<p class="ph3"><span class="smcap">Somerville.</span></p>


<p>For the apportionment of fifteen thousand men to the
Commonwealth, Somerville had to raise ninety-two men
and this she succeeded in doing within the months of July
and August. The aggregate bounty paid each enlisted
man was one hundred and twenty-five dollars, one hundred
dollars coming from the town, the remainder from private
subscription.</p>

<p>The selectmen, acting as agents, had recommended three
men as commissioned officers of the projected company,
and these, all of whom had seen service in the Somerville
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>Company of the Fifth Regiment, M. V. M., in its three
months' tour of duty, applied themselves diligently to
their task. Camp was pitched on Prospect Hill and the
flagstaff, erected there and then, remained until the digging
down of the hill some fifteen years later; this occupation
if possible added to the fame of the spot on which Israel
Putnam had intrenched himself after falling back from
Bunker Hill. The stay on elevated and breezy Prospect
was far from tedious, the nearness of home supplies more
than compensating for any hardships incident to camp
duties. Mustered into the U. S. service, August 12, the
Company remained here until September 2nd, when it
proceeded to Boxford, there to join the other companies
which were to constitute the Thirty-ninth Regiment,
having had no taste of the stay in Lynnfield, the rendezvous
of the other companies. The Commissioned officers were
captain, Fred R. Kinsley; first lieutenant, Joseph J.
Giles; second lieutenant, Willard C. Kinsley. All of the
officers had been commissioned in the Thirty-eighth Regiment,
Captain Kinsley and Lieutenant Giles, August 14th,
and Lieutenant Kinsley, August 8th, but the assignment of
the company to the Thirty-ninth Regiment compelled
the transferal of the officers.</p>

    <h2>COMPANY F.</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3"><span class="smcap">Taunton.</span></p>


<p>Work for the formation of what was to be Company F
did not begin until the 5th day of August, when a meeting
of the sub-committee of the military committee was held
to consider the raising of a new company, Captain Presbry,
one of the selectmen, presiding, with T. Gordon,
secretary. Joseph J. Cooper was authorized to raise a
company under the conditions as stated in a letter of the
Adjutant General, dated July 29, '64, and the general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
order of the War Department, Number Seventy-five. The
<cite>Taunton Gazette</cite> comments that the lieutenancies will be
offered to Isaac D. Paul and John D. Reed, both men of
integrity, and "it is believed that the company will be speedily
filled and that it will be one of the most creditable of
those provided by Taunton." The record for the 6th of
August was that Captain Cooper had opened a recruiting
office in Templar Hall Building, and had secured about a
dozen names. By the 7th, the total had risen to twenty-four
men; the 8th saw thirty-six names enrolled and, on
the 11th, the tide had risen to forty-seven good and true
patriots. The 13th beheld the citizens assembled in town
meeting, wherein it was voted to increase the bounty to
two hundred dollars, thus adding a stimulus which resulted
in filling the company to the maximum. The 18th was a
day of memories for the good old town, since on this date
the new company departed for the rendezvous at Lynnfield.
The largest assemblage of people that the town had
seen since the leaving of the Seventh Regiment, early in
the war, was out at seven o'clock in the morning to witness
the going of the new soldiers. They formed on the green,
whence they were escorted by the Light Guard, with music
by the Bridgewater Brass Band, to the railroad station.
Followed by the enthusiastic cheering of the populace, the
men were borne away to new scenes and experiences.
Five days later or on the 23rd, the men had a furlough
home for twenty-four hours, returning to camp on the 24th.
Of course, Company F moved with the other companies
in the transfer to Boxford, where on the 3rd of September,
a noteworthy incident took place. The men of Taunton's
company were drawn up in front of their tents when George
Childs, Esq., in behalf of Taunton citizens, presented
Captain Cooper and Lieutenants Paul and Reed with
elegantly mounted revolvers, each officer responding in a
very happy manner. Captain, Joseph J. Cooper; first
lieutenant, Isaac D. Paul; second lieutenant, John D.
Reed.</p>

    <h2>COMPANY G.</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3"><span class="smcap">Boston, Hingham, Scituate and the South Shore.</span></p>


<p>From information furnished chiefly by Lieut. J. H. Prouty
it seems that Hingham was about as liberal a contributor
to Company G as any single place, having thirty-seven
men in the ranks of "G" and another in "D." It was the
only company in the regiment that started without some
local head or centre. When the call came, Hingham took
action at once, and on the 5th held a town meeting at
four o'clock p. m., with Captain John Stephenson presiding;
it was voted to raise five thousand dollars to aid the families
of volunteers as state aid, and a thousand more to be distributed
under the direction of the selectmen. July 11th
brought the people together again, in the evening of Friday,
to take action towards filling the town's quota of fifty-one
men; Luther Stephenson presided and several patriotic
addresses were given; it was voted to pay seventy-five dollars
bounty to every man enlisting, a committee of twelve
was appointed to co-operate with the selectmen in securing
enlistments. This committee met on the 15th, organized,
heard a deal of eloquent speaking and voted to recommend
to the townspeople that a bounty of one hundred dollars be
paid to every volunteer. The Town accepted, July 19th,
the recommendation of the citizens' committee. On the
same evening, a number of volunteers put down their
names. An adjourned war meeting was held on the 22nd,
and a large committee of ladies was chosen to help forward
the filling of the quota. The next meeting, August 6th, was
on the call of the ladies and was largely attended; August
15th, the town voted to make the bounty for each volunteer
two hundred dollars. The thirty-seven Hingham men
who went into Company G were not all new to service,
for two, at least, had gone out with the Lincoln Light
Infantry in the Fourth Regiment in 1861, on the first call
for troops. The volunteers expected to go with the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>Thirty third
Massachusetts; next with the Thirty-fifth, but finally
fetched up with the Thirty-ninth. They had no officers.
The governor commissioned, as captain, Ezra J. Trull,
better known as "Jack" Trull, who had been a corporal
in the Thirteenth Massachusetts, and he was assigned to
the command of "G." Though only nineteen years old,
he was one of the best drilled officers in the regiment and
his active, stirring nature kept his company in excellent
shape. He was a Boston man, as was the first lieutenant,
C. W. Thompson; the second lieutenant, C. Henry Chapman,
was from Cambridge. First and last, more than thirty
cities and towns contributed to the roll of the company.</p>

<p class="ph3"><span class="smcap">Dorchester.</span></p>


<p>Early action was taken in Dorchester towards raising
the town's quota of one hundred and thirty-seven men. On
the 15th of July, the citizens convened at the town hall with
James H. Upham, moderator, and they started proceedings
by the singing of patriotic songs. It was voted to pay all
recruits one hundred dollars, and to borrow fourteen thousand
dollars for such purpose. The selectmen were empowered
to carry out the expressed will of the meeting and the
same board was directed to see to the securing of enlistments,
by the appointment of a "suitable person" to raise
a military company as a part of the town's quota. The
Hall had been plentifully bedecked with flags, some one
hundred in number, among them there being one that had
been borne in the Revolution. Besides, there were curios
and relics to excite the curiosity and patriotism of all
beholders, the display being the work of Frederick F.
Hassam, who received the enthusiastic thanks of the meeting
for his thoughtfulness and action. On the 19th there
was a great meeting on Meeting House Hill, with artillery
company firing sixty-eight guns and the Hon. Marshall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
P. Wilder presiding; of the event the <cite>Boston Journal</cite> says:
"Shoulder Arms! Forward, March!" The Company left
Dorchester Wednesday, August 13, receiving a parting
salute from Captain Harris' Battery; in Boston there was
a short parade with refreshments, 1.30 p. m., at John
Preston's chocolate establishment on State Street. A
hearty escort was given by the selectmen, many citizens,
and Fire Engine Company Number 5, and all kept step
to music afforded by a brass band. From Boston, cars on
the Boston and Maine Railroad bore the men, one hundred
and thirty-seven in number, to Lynnfield. Captain,

lieutenant, Robert Williams.</p>

<p class="ph3"><span class="smcap">Natick.</span></p>


<p>Natick was expected to provide one hundred and three
men, or just a company, and this she set about doing
through a meeting in the evening of July 17th, in School
House Hall, over which the Hon. J. W. Bacon presided.
To report a plan of action, the following committee was
appointed: Leonard Winch, John J. Perry and E. P. Fay.
Another meeting on the 25th voted to pay volunteers
one hundred and fifty dollars each, and a committee of
fifteen was appointed to assist the recruiting officers.
Monday, July 28th, brought out a great meeting which
was addressed by United States Senator Henry Wilson,
Capt. Ephraim H. Brigham and others. By August 1st,
matters had reached ignition pitch with a great meeting
in the Town Hall, Captain Brigham presiding; there were
eloquent speeches, but the one which excited the most
admiration was that of Benning Hall, Jr., the village expressman,
who on this occasion made his first public address,
chiefly to his comrades, of whom twenty-two had
put down their names. The fourth public meeting was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
held August 4th, in School House Hall, Lieut. Simon
Mulligan in the chair, and it was voted to act at once, and
to talk afterwards. Then followed "a scene such as few
people ever witness" when forty-seven men marched up and
signed the roll amid waving hats and handkerchiefs, the
very best men in the grand old town. The Hon. Henry
Wilson was present and spoke, as did Edward Choate,
G. L. Sawin, H. B. Moore, C. B. Phillips and B. Hill, Jr.
In one week Natick had raised one hundred and twenty-seven
men for her company, twenty-four more than necessary.
It was Saturday, August 9, that, escorted by the
Victor and Union Fire Company, and crowds of citizens,
the Natick newly enlisted men set forth for their rendezvous.
After a brief parade in Boston, Lynnfield was sought in
the afternoon, where the reception was not just what the
would-be soldiers expected. So many recruits had reported
there was no room for the Natick people, who had to hire
a building outside for use until the departure of a regiment
gave them access to the regular quarters. Captain,
Ephraim H. Brigham; first lieutenant, Simon Mulligan;
second lieutenant, William H. Brown.</p>

    <h2>COMPANY K.</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3"><span class="smcap">Woburn.</span></p>


<p>Woburn's assignment was ninety-eight men and it came
at a time when recruiting was dull. Still the selectmen,
in obedience to State House orders, called a meeting of
Union loving citizens in the Town Hall, on the evening
of Saturday, the 12th of July. The response was large and
enthusiastic; it was voted to give every volunteer a bounty
of one hundred dollars and a committee of fifteen was
appointed to forward enlistments. It was further voted
to call a town meeting on the 24th of the month for the
purpose of carrying out the provisions of this popular
gathering. Thirty-three men had enlisted or put down their

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">Aug., '62</span>

names before the excitement began or the offer of bounty
was made, and these men became "the immortal thirty-three"
in company annals. Recruiting began on the 15th,
and was very slow, though the office was open day and
evening. At the town meeting, it was voted to give a
bounty of one hundred and twenty-five dollars, and enlistments
thereupon increased. Under the encouragement
of a grand rally and a banquet in upper Lyceum Hall
in the evening of the 24th, followed by a march through
the streets accompanied by a brass band and speeches by
prominent citizens, the roll of enlistments reached fifty
names. Subsequent rallies and parades resulted in the
securing of considerably more than the required number
by the 1st of August. On the 5th of the month, after a
collation in Lyceum Hall, escorted by the Fire Department,
the company departed for the rendezvous, Camp
Stanton, in Lynnfield, having the following commissioned
officers: captain, John I. Richardson; first lieutenant, Luke
R. Tidd; second lieutenant, Luther F. Wyman.</p>

<p class="mt2">Life at a rendezvous camp is much the same, wherever
found. The change from the untrammeled habits of home
to the restrained conditions of military life is seldom made
without friction on the part of the newly enlisted men, and
if there were a lack of quarters, an insufficiency of food,
and if the latter were of indifferent quality, they were only
features to be expected wherever and whenever inexperienced
citizens undertake the transforming act of becoming
soldiers. However disagreeable some of the conditions
at Camp Stanton may have been, nothing was encountered
there that would not have been laughed at, when two years
later the men were passing through the exactions of the
"Battle Summer" or later still, when they realized the
horrors of Salisbury and Andersonville. Nor were the
days of Lynnfield altogether disagreeable to the recruits,
for were there not the visits of home friends who always
came laden with the best of goodies for the "boys," and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
passes for brief trips to the homes themselves? Besides
every day had its round of duties, such as guard, the policing
of the camp and the early induction to drill, even before
the giving out of uniform and arms.</p>

<p>Col. Edward F. Jones, who had won distinction in the
earlier months of the war as commander of the Sixth Regiment,
and later had been assigned to the colonelcy of the
Twenty-sixth Infantry, was in command of the camp and
occasionally the newly made soldiers repined at the rigor
of his commands, quite uncalled for to their undisciplined
minds. Nothing, however, better exhibited the adaptability
of the American soldier than the speed with which the
material from school, shop and farm, caught the step,
learned the manual and responded to the command of superior
officers. In the case of the companies that were to
constitute the Thirty-ninth Regiment, they arrived after
the most of the desirable quarters had been taken by the
men of the Thirty-fifth and the Thirty-eighth Regiments.
The first named departed for the front on the 22nd of
August; on the 24th, the Thirty-eighth took train for the
South and as colonel went Timothy Ingraham who originally
had been commissioned as the leader of the Thirty-ninth;
a Captain in the Third Infantry during the three
months' service, he had been lieutenant colonel in the
Eighteenth Infantry and there were feelings of regret when
the New Bedford officer was transferred to the earlier
numbered organization.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter">
    <h2>BOXFORD</h2>
</div>


<p>The limitations of Lynnfield finally became so apparent
that the authorities determined to seek a new location
and officers were directed to investigate, the result being
that Boxford, still further away from Boston (twenty-eight
miles) was selected. Here were the grounds that had been
used as a musterfield by the Second Brigade, Second Division

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">Sept. 1, '62</span>

of the State Militia and, on this extended plain by the
side of a beautiful pond of water, it was determined to
pitch the new camp. Orders were given for the cooking
of three days' rations and on the 28th, by special trains
the troops were transferred from Lynnfield to Boxford.
It is possible that had the nearness of the day of starting
for the front been known the trouble of removal had been
avoided. Colonel Jones still commanded the camp which
continued to be called "Stanton" and the commandant's
rules were quite as rigid as ever. On the 29th, some of
the soldiers were gladdened by the receipt from the State
of twenty-five dollars' bounty and they soon found ways
enough for disposing of it, though many of them had signed
allotment papers, agreeing to have a portion of their pay
reserved for friends at home.</p>

<p>Camp life during the week's stay in Boxford had its
share of variation such as came from short trips away,
the visits of friends, the receiving of uniforms, arms and
equipments and the presentation of gifts to officers and men.
Sept. 1st brought Col. P. Stearns Davis, the new commander
of the Thirty-ninth Regiment. A brigadier general in
the militia, he had been one of the most efficient of those
assisting Governor Andrew in organizing and forwarding
regiments, and the governor parted from the officer with
regret; he succeeded Colonel Jones in the command of the
Camp. Company officers were remembered by their friends,
both those in the ranks and outside; on the 29th of August,
his company gave to Captain Richardson of "K" a set of
equipments and on the 1st of September, when on leave
of absence in Woburn, Lieutenants Tidd and Wyman were
presented by citizens with swords and sashes. Sept. 2nd,
Company E, from Somerville, appeared in camp, the very
last to report. On the 3rd, the commissioned officers of
Company F, Taunton, were given revolvers by their fellow
townsmen, of whom there was a goodly number present,
their representative being George Childs, Esq. On this
day also Springfield rifles were placed in the men's hands,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
accoutrements following on the 4th, so that they began
to feel like real soldiers. On the 3rd also appeared Lieutenant
Ladd, U. S. A., who began paying out one month's
pay in advance. During these days the ladies of Woburn
made and presented to the Woburn Company (K) a
National flag, Miss Henrietta M. Young making the address
of presentation and Lieutenant Tidd receiving, though the
acceptance speech, in the absence of the captain, was made
by Lieutenant Wyman. The flag was returned to Woburn
to be retained there until the return of the company from
its three years' term of service.</p>

    <h2>BOXFORD TO WASHINGTON.</h2>
</div>


<p>On Friday, the 5th, came the regimental colors and
orders to prepare three days' rations against the expected
departure of the Thirty-ninth on the following day, and
the same day saw the first dress-parade of the regiment under
the command of Colonel Davis, also the efforts of embryo
soldiers as they tried to pack into a knapsack two or three
times as much as it would hold. When the active campaigning
began, they were to learn some of the wisdom of
Socrates when he exclaimed, "How many things there are
that I do not need." Breaking camp on the morning of the
6th was a spirited affair and, after an early breakfast, line
was formed and the men marched to the station not far
from 8 o'clock a. m. Here came a lesson in delay that was
to be repeated many times as the years moved on. Boston
was sighted between 1 and 2 p. m. and, speedily disembarking,
the regiment took its way through the city to the
Boston and Worcester station. The day was extremely
hot, the men had overloaded their knapsacks, hence many
suffered badly, some having to fall out, though all reached
the station in time for the train. Company E, Somerville,
held the right of the line and "C" Medford, the left, so
that double-quick, with the Medford men, was the order

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">Sept. 6, '62</span>

occasionally which, considering the heat, was a trying
test. Of the march through Washington Street, the <cite>Boston
Journal</cite> has this comment, "The men appeared hardy,
robust and of excellent fighting material and were evidently
superior in drill to many of the new regiments."</p>

<p>Though the crowds were great and friends by the hundred,
not to say thousands, were there to say "Good-bye,"
the greetings and partings were had in passing, as the
quickstep was kept through the city. At the station, the
regiment was soon entrained for Worcester, as its next
step on its southern way. There was no lack of interest
in the departure by people all along the route to Worcester,
and there the good citizens were not slow in supplying
food, somewhat more appetizing than the rations borne
in the haversacks; said rations in many cases became useless
through the taste imparted by the recently painted
receptacles, the traces of turpentine working through.
One veteran relates, at this late day, his anguish over the
spoiling of a quantity of fresh mother's made doughnuts.
Thence, via the Norwich route, the way was southward,
the first train reaching Groton, Connecticut, the summer
terminus, about 10.30 in the evening. As the soldier-laden
train was in two sections, there was a somewhat prolonged
wait here for the arrival of the second part. However,
sometime between 10.30 and midnight the steamer
"City of New York" proceeded on its way to the great
city, along the Sound, over which had passed so many New
England men and boys on their Union-preserving mission.
Though there was ample space on the soft side of the respective
decks for the soldiers to lie down, there was altogether
too much novelty for them to encamp at once.
While the majority secured some sleep during the passage,
there were those who watched the night through and were
ready to greet the dawn and to experience the sensations
of an early approach to the mightiest city of the Western
Continent. Those who saw that sunrise and the course
through East River and the final round-up at the Jersey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
City landing never forgot it; besides, the morning sights
included a view of the "Great Eastern", the famous British
steamship, then the greatest in the world and the wonder
of all beholders.</p>

<p>Sunday morning at 8 o'clock, the steamer was docked at
Jersey City and soon afterward the regiment was again
embarked on a train for the trip through New Jersey and,
though it was Sunday and, presumably, many people were
at church, there seemed to be no lack of generous citizens,
ready to supply the most luscious of fruit and to prove
that whatever fun might be had at the expense of the
state's being a "foreign country" the hearts of the people
were all right. The day itself was in that delightful early
fall, when Dame Nature does her best to outdo her June
wonders, and the hearts of the Massachusetts travellers
were all aglow as they saw the possibilities of the Garden
State and when, having been ferried across the Delaware
River, Philadelphia was reached, every man was in splendid
appetite for the lavish lunch that the ladies of the City of
Brotherly Love had prepared for them in the Cooper
Refreshment Rooms. Few Eastern soldiers failed at some
time in their experience to test the hospitality of William
Penn's great city and that veteran is yet to be found who
does not wax eloquent over the spread there afforded, and
that was his without money and without price.</p>

<p>The march through Philadelphia was an enjoyable one,
the people being in such evident sympathy with the men,
who at every step were going further from their own homes
and loved ones. When the station was reached, whence
they were to start for Baltimore, there was a considerable
halt during which the Massachusetts boys had a fine chance
to make the acquaintances of certain of the fair daughters
of the Keystone State and addresses were exchanged which,
in subsequent months, afforded pleasure to both man and
maiden, as letters passed between those in the field and
the loyal dwellers on the banks of the Schuylkill. The ride
southward, according to some of the chroniclers, was not

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">Sept. 7, '62</span>

as enjoyable as the previous portions had been; indeed
one careful writer says, "Here the comfort of our journey
ceased for we were put aboard cattle cars, with rough and
hard seats"; in most cases, no seats at all; yet the time
would come when that writer would be delighted to ride
standing, on platform cars even, if thereby he could the
sooner gain his destination. Wilmington, Delaware,
reached at midnight or thereabouts, was the first stop and,
notwithstanding the lateness of the hour there was a modified
repetition of the Philadelphia reception, every one
being anxious to contribute to the well being of the "boys
in blue." Among those in waiting were former dwellers in
the Bay State who were delighted to grasp the hands of
men just from the old home.</p>

<p>The crossing of the Susquehanna River from Perryville,
Delaware, to Havre-de-Grace was a source of great interest
to these tyros of travel, and whole trains of cars, run
aboard great ferryboats at once, for a trip over the river
to the Maryland town opposite, excited not a little wonder,
if not admiration. On reaching the further side of the river,
the usual waiting was experienced and, though it was in
the dead of night, those young soldiers were too full of
life to allow the time to waste and in their search for mischief
they discovered that the place abounded in geese and,
long after midnight, these representatives of staid and sober
New England awoke not alone the squawking fowls but
the people as well and, over and through the gullied ways
of this first bit of "Maryland, My Maryland" that they
had encountered, these men, on fierce battle bent, pursued
these poor feathered bipeds, though what they were to
accomplish by a complete round-up, they had not the least
notion. However, from any such test they were happily
saved by the appearance on the scene of Colonel Davis
who, apprised by the noise of the need of his presence,
admonished his valiant followers to cease harrying the
birds; nor were the mischievous fellows sorry, for they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
gone about as far as they could and not have their fun
changed into serious fault.</p>

<p>The regiment had reached the region where constant
watch was kept over stations, railroad bridges and all
points where it might be easy to obstruct transportation;
hence the sight of dimly seen figures performing sentinel
duty as the train swept along was not a little interesting
to the men who were, as rapidly as possible, advancing from
the abode of peace and plenty to that of privation and
danger. Dawn of the 8th brought with it the entrance
of Baltimore by the latest Massachusetts organization and,
as the men marched through the silent streets in the early
morning, many of them contrasted the reception accorded
them in the unquestionably loyal city of Philadelphia,
and that in the Monument City, which a year and five
months before had caused the first bloodshed in the Civil
War. A substantial breakfast was served at the Union
refreshment rooms, though nothing like the generous
spread made the day before by the ladies of the city on the
Schuylkill. Several regiments, like the Thirty-ninth on
their way South, were found waiting orders and transportation
and the situation was somewhat emphasized by the
sudden and serious illness of a number of soldiers, the rumor
gaining circulation that they had been poisoned. Fortunately
before the irate soldiers could begin retaliatory
measures against the people, it was decided that the ailment
was simply <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cholera morbus</i>, occasioned by injudicious
eating of green fruit obtained in transit.</p>

<p>Ellicott's Mills, not so very far from Baltimore, towards
the west, was at first announced as the destination of the
regiment, but, as there was no supply of tents or wagons,
the order was countermanded and cars were taken for
Washington. The sight of the incomplete Capitol and other
public buildings was a glad one to these Massachusetts
men who, in spite of warlike intentions, were alive to all
of the geographical attractions that they might encounter.
Reaching the Nation's centre of activity somewhat late

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">Sept. 9, '62</span>

in the afternoon there was some time in which to take
cursory glances of many edifices, already familiar through
picture and print. Supper and lodgings were found in the
barracks, close by the Baltimore and Ohio depot, and
those who did not like the fare at the barracks, and could
afford the price, had the privilege of supping outside.
Weariness can sleep upon a flinty bed while lazy sloth may
toss upon the softest of couches, hence the floor of the so-called
"Soldiers' Rest" afforded comfort for the cattle
car travellers. In the morning of the 9th, it was discovered
that the Tenth Vermont had arrived during the night and
was encamped outside, a regiment with which the Thirty-ninth
was eventually to be brigaded for a time.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter">
    <h2>POTOMAC CROSSED.</h2>
</div>


<p>The breakfast was not of a sort to elicit any great amount
of praise from the soldiers and once more those who could
got their food outside, and the forenoon was passed largely
in seeing the sights of the Capital. Very likely the folks
at home were thinking that their boys were so much needed
that they were to be ordered into battle-line at once; but
all concerned were to learn that in the fiercest of wars there
are many waits, and this delay in Washington was incident
to finding out just where the Thirty-ninth was to report, for
all knew very well they were not to halt there long. The
orders came from Gen. Silas Casey in time for them to
move out of the city about noon and so to take their way
across the Long Bridge, the thoroughfare connection between
Washington and Alexandria, then the most famous
structure of its kind in America; on account of the vibrations
the regular route-step was broken. The day was hot and
sultry, the dust intense, made so by the constant passing
of horses and men, and the newly enlisted soldiers, loaded
down with their bloated knapsacks and other burdens,
began to think that soldiering was no joking matter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>While thus advancing into Virginia the Thirteenth
Massachusetts Infantry was encountered, the men having
all of the activity and swing that come from long experience,
though thinned ranks spoke volumes for the encounters
they had passed through, but they were in no halting
mood and with only the greetings possible in passing the
Bay State men kept in motion. It was the time when the
disastrous Second Bull Run had necessitated realignment,
and measures were afoot which in a little more than a
week were to lead up to Antietam. It was a march of
seven miles which brought the dust begrimed men to the
vicinity of Fort Albany, an extensive fortification situated
on the estate of Gen. Robert E. Lee, the famous Virginian
so prominent in the Confederate Army, a locality rapidly
growing in reputation as Arlington. Though camp equipage
had not as yet made its appearance, the weather was
so dry and warm no trouble was found in camping without
other outfit. In every direction the eye could see very
little save tents and campfires, with the passing of long
baggage trains, and the night air bore the strains of many
bands of music, all joining in a mighty effort to keep the
minds of the soldiers alert and free from the care which
besets solitude and repose.</p>

<p>On the slopes of Arlington the morning of the 10th found
the regiment, its members all alert to observe and learn
the lessons of each successive day. The night had brought
about great changes, for a large portion of the camps so
apparent during the watches of the night had entirely
disappeared; to be sure there had been some extra fires
during the preceding hours when, as it appeared later,
camp debris had been burned, but all of these indications
were lost on the newcomers, to whom the symptoms of
breaking camp were unfamiliar, and how should they
know that already the fates were preparing for Antietam,
the bloodiest single day's fight of the entire war? That
the enemy was not very remote was currently reported
and many of the young soldiers thought they might be

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">Sept. 12, '62</span>

ordered into the fray at an early hour. Then too, for the
first time, they saw the coming into the Union line of
escaped negroes, the "contrabands" of General Butler's
ruling; "strange looking beings," one of the observers
remarks. The 11th day differed in no essential from its
predecessor save that the arrival of tents permitted the
pitching of them and the instituting of regular and strict
camp orders. The proximity of great earthworks, known
as forts, prompted many to visit them and thus to appreciate
the efforts that had been made to render safe the
nation's capital. Drills were begun, roll-calls were frequent
and the first dress parade in Dixie was recorded for
the Thirty-ninth on this day.</p>

<p>After a day of routine on the 12th, while companies were
forming for battalion drill, orders came to pack up and be
ready to move out. It was after dark and in the midst of
a driving rain that the start was made, but through the
mud and darkness the regiment proceeded with as much
willingness as the circumstances would permit till, at last,
after what seemed a very long time and a great distance,
really the latter was only two miles, the welcome command,
"halt," was heard, and as it was not followed by one to
move forward the men were content, the rain having
stopped, to throw themselves upon the ground and there
to find the rest that ever comes to the weary whatever the
conditions. The regiment was now near the outermost
lines and pickets were thrown out. The next morning,
13th, revealed the location as near Fort Tillinghast, and
work was immediately begun on clearing the ground for a
camp, this being the third effort for this purpose made by
the men and some of them hoped they might be allowed to
remain long enough to see just how a real camp at the front
would look. It appeared that to the Thirty-ninth had
been assigned the duty of picketing the line between
Forts Tillinghast and Craig. Here Sibley tents were
received, the same having been left by the Sixteenth Maine
on the departure of the latter for the march into Maryland.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
This was the introduction of the Thirty-ninth to an organization
whose later history was considerably involved with
that of our Massachusetts men.</p>

<p>The forts, which occupied almost every elevation of land,
were conspicuous on every hand, and were a part of the
system devised for the thorough protection of Washington.
They numbered in all, including batteries, sixty-eight,
and were for the most part named for distinguished officers
slain in the conflict. All of them were not constructed
at this time, but the record includes those that were built
later as well. The total perimeter of the fortifications was
thirteen miles, and the outer border thus guarded was
nearly or quite equal to that of the original District of
Columbia. Besides the forts there were twenty miles of
rifle trenches, thirty-two miles of military roads and ninety-three
unarmed batteries for field guns, with four hundred
and one emplacements. In the total armament of these
earthworks there were nearly a thousand cannon and
mortars. Notwithstanding this formidable array, Early
and his men came near getting through and into the city
in July, 1864.</p>

    <h2>ON THE MARCH.</h2>
</div>


<p>Whatever hopes of permanency may have been cherished
as to the new camp they were all destroyed before
the day (14th) was done. There were inspections, always
a Sunday feature, the distribution of cartridges, which had
a businesslike aspect, and the dispatching of three companies
to the picket line only to be recalled later with orders
to pack up and be ready for a long march. In addition it
was ordered that knapsacks be left behind, a fact that
brought up visions of forced marching and a possible
encounter. To the inexperienced soldiers separation from
their knapsacks was a serious matter and each man debated

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">Sept. 15, '62</span>

with himself as to what he could best leave behind, the
upshot of it all being that generally his blanket, tied in a
roll and slung over the shoulder, was the one item deemed
absolutely necessary. It was quite seven o'clock before
the march began, the way being through camps and along
the sides of forts until the Aqueduct Bridge, leading across
the Potomac to Georgetown, was reached; the name of
the bridge arising from the fact that the Chesapeake and
Ohio Canal crossed here, terminating in Alexandria. Over
the bridge and through Georgetown the pace was a brisk
one until, after a march of possibly seven miles, a halt for
the remainder of the night was ordered on a prominence
back of the village of Tennallytown.</p>

<p>The 15th began with the soldiers at five o'clock and
there was a march of fully two miles before the halt for
breakfast. Apparently in the same line with our men
were the Tenth Vermont and a Pennsylvania Battery
and the news gradually spread through the ranks that
the purpose of the speedy trip was to do picket duty
along the Potomac River. To the undisciplined mind
it did seem as though a less headlong pace might have
been set for such an end, but it was not for the men to
complain nor to reason why, but rather to plod along as
rapidly as possible. Inasmuch as the heat was extreme,
the roads dusty, many of the men, quite unused to the
strain and wilting under the sun's rays, fell out. This
day, too, the preparation of meals was entirely by the
soldiers themselves, company cooks having done the
work before. When a halt was ordered it was obeyed
with the utmost alacrity, the men throwing themselves
upon the ground with expressions of relief. When at last,
after another advance, there came the orders to halt and
prepare coffee, they were heard with gladness, the location
being near an old mill on Waitt's Branch, this being an
affluent of the Big Muddy Branch, but the night was not
to be spent here, the officers deciding that it was not a
defensible place, hence the march was continued in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
most quiet manner possible, to the brow of a hill where
camp was pitched for the night. In the light of subsequent
knowledge that the enemy was many miles away,
the extreme caution must have been the result of false
information to those leading.</p>

<p>Another day, 16th, began early and the route was still
up the Potomac, though the pace was not so rapid as that
of yesterday. At noon dinner was eaten at Seneca Mills
and then followed a stretch of about fifteen miles, leading
up to Poolesville, a village by no means important in
itself, yet it had been heard of frequently in Massachusetts
since here, or in this locality, a year ago were encamped
the Fifteenth, Nineteenth and Twentieth Regiments
from the Bay State and through here had marched
the Thirteenth. To Lieut. Colonel Peirson and Major
Tremlett, the place must have seemed very familiar since
both had been officers in the Twentieth. Not a few of the
latest visitors thought that its size and appearance hardly
comported with its notoriety. A sudden and violent rainstorm
accompanied the entrance of the place where were
found two cavalry companies on duty, who informed the
inquirers that the Battle of Poolesville, shouted so loudly
a few days before at Arlington, was really only a skirmish,
in which the only casualty was the killing of a horse, the
whole affair being one of many incidents, accompanying
the movements of Stuart's Cavalry in the general advance
of General Lee into Maryland. Notwithstanding the
rain, weary men threw themselves upon the ground, glad
to rest in any way anywhere; but long before morning the
fierceness of the storm and the level character of the plain
on which the men were lying, reducing the latter to something
like a duck-pond, made the soldiers get up, build
fires and try to dry themselves, but with indifferent success.</p>

<p>The day of Antietam's great battle, the 17th of September,
found the regiment making coffee around fires that
were larger than usual, owing to the moisture that pervaded
everything, but wet or dry, there was to be no pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>tracted

<span class="sidenote smcap">Sept. 17, '62</span>

halt here and the village, later to be quite familiar
to the Thirty-ninth, was left behind as the regiment plodded
along about three miles further. Turning off into some
woods, camp was established, rations drawn and preparations
were progressing for staying a while when orders
came, directing five companies (B, C, D, G, and K) to go on
picket at once. Marching about two miles further, the
river was reached by the companies at Edward's Ferry.
The latter is thirty-five miles from Washington and the
section had been more or less mixed up with the war from
the very start. Edward's Ferry was familiar on account
of the Battle of Ball's Bluff, just across the Potomac, on
the 21st day of October, one year before. Out in the
river is Harrison's Island, a bit of land that had been seen
in fancy by thousands of Northern people whose loved
ones had died there. The road, traversed by the men,
was the Leesburg pike, the ferry being one of the features
of the way. While the country is attractive, with the historic
river flowing through it, the soldiers were not there
for historic studies. Posting one company at the Ferry
as the extreme left, the men were strung along the river to
Conrad's Ferry, five miles further up the stream. So on
the banks of Old Potomac began the duties of soldiering
in a region that had already echoed to battle's din. Parallel
with the Potomac, sluggishly flows the Chesapeake and
Ohio Canal and along its banks many of the picket groups
were posted. Five miles to be under observation by about
five hundred men or, as they were posted in groups of five,
there were twenty posts to the mile and, if stationed at
equal intervals, each set of sentinels was responsible for
sixteen rods, but other circumstances than mere distance
determined the placing of men on picket. Probably no
more vigilant soldiers than these of the Thirty-ninth ever
watched the river and opposite shore, for the novelty of
the situation and the knowledge that the rebels were within
shooting distance made the responsibility great. Besides,
the rumbles from distant Antietam, throughout the 17th,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
were calculated to waken apprehensions in the minds of
men who had no means of knowing what way the fight
was going.</p>





<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter">
    <h2>PICKET DUTY.</h2>
</div>


<p>Thence onward till the 23rd of the month this tour of
duty continued and however irksome it may have been
to many, as a rule, men preferred such service to the routine
of roll-call and almost constant drill in camp. Happily
for these tyros in military experience, nothing of note disturbed
the general quiet of the period, though every man
was on the alert for the first indication of hostile approach.
The proximity of Maryland farms and well-filled larders
suggested foraging and, while some of the men paid for the
food which they obtained, others did not, and a considerable
raid is recorded which resulted in the bringing into
camp of a great variety of material, both animal and vegetable,
as well as cereals and fruit. While it was new business
for the majority of these well brought up young men,
they speedily adapted themselves to their new conditions,
and rare was the soldier who could not secure food to eat
if anything of the kind were within reaching distance. It
is said that bills, aggregating fifty dollars, were presented
to the Colonel by suffering farmers from the afflicted locality
and they were paid by someone, though the amount was
later assessed upon the offending companies. Sickness
made its appearance among the men, largely the result
of indiscretion in eating, the abundance of all sorts of fruit
inducing indulgence therein to the extent of serious stomach
and bowel difficulties. Also, the individual cooking done
by the men may have had a share in the disorders named,
for while some of the combinations of fried pork, apples
and molasses may have been very palatable, they certainly
were a surprise to many of the stomachs, into which
they were introduced. At the same time the lesson of self
help had to be learned.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">Sept., '62</span>

On the 23rd, the companies on picket were relieved by
those in camp and there came a chance to receive the knapsacks
left at Arlington on the 14th, and the extra clothing
thus was appreciated by all to whom the coldness of Southern
nights was a revelation. Shelter tents were distributed
and every one speedily learned how much comfort
could be found beneath them. Here too began in good
earnest the school of the soldier, and four drills a day,
along with roll-calls at frequent intervals, induced a
degree of attention and a weariness that made many a lad
seek his rest, when possible, without any prompting. The
first death in the regiment came on the 27th, when Nathan
Mitchell, a Bridgewater boy, Company F, twenty-one
years old, passed out of this life. The funeral was held the
next (Sunday) morning, an impressive lesson for the soldiers
of the possibility of death in camp as well as on the battlefield.</p>

<p>For a number of days there followed a regular exchange
of duties between camp and picket, the latter being considered
preferable, as a rule, having so much less of drill
and the fretful features of military life. Men learned to
wash their own garments, to mend their apparel and to do
many things of which, had they remained at home, they
would always have been ignorant. The bi-weekly arrival
of the mail was a regular event that never lost its interest,
and happiness and misery were separated only by the receipt
of letters or their failure. The folks at home knew this
full well, and there were few boys in blue for whom some
one in the distant Northland was not planning some
pleasant interlude during these months of separation. Confederate
prisoners, too, were not unusual, on their way
under guard to Washington, and while they at first excited
curiosity, the latter feeling was mingled with wonder at
their lack of uniform and the general soldierly appearance
which the Union soldiers maintained. Under the impression
that the Maryland side was held by his people one rebel
forded the Potomac, clad in citizen's garb, wearing a Penn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>sylvanian's
knapsack which, he said, he had acquired at
Manassas; he was a queer looking soldier, though he claimed
to belong to the Sixth Florida Infantry. Someway, he
had managed to get off the rebel route on the way back
from Antietam. It was no infrequent thing for an alarm to
bring the men into line at any time of night and to make
them stand thus until daylight did appear. Seemingly the
foe was constantly fording the Potomac above or below the
portion guarded by the Thirty-ninth Regiment. In one
case, the "sure rebels," who had built fires across the river,
proved to be the division of General E. V. Sumner returning
from a raid upon the wagon-train of General Lee.</p>

<p>Since reaching "Old Potomac's Shore" no more memorable
day had been recorded than Sunday, October 12th,
when the regular inspection was interrupted by the arrival
of a courier with orders to march at once since the enemy
was crossing the river at one of the upper fords, and skirmishing
was already in progress. Much to the wonder of
some, in spite of the urgency the inspection was finished
and the rations drawn before the Thirty-ninth, in heavy
marching array, started off at a double-quick, to make
up for lost time. The heat of the day and the heaviness
of the attire made the march exceedingly trying, but
Conrad's Ferry was reached at last, knapsacks were unslung,
line of battle was formed, and the approach of the
enemy was awaited; but in vain, for the rapid riders of
J. E. B. Stuart had already crossed at White's Ford, two
miles further up the stream. Some of the hypercritical
soldiers thought that if the inspection had been ended at
once and the march made in light order, the Thirty-ninth
might have arrived in time to interrupt the placid passage
of the Potomac by the venturesome Confederates.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter">
    <h2>STUART'S RAID.</h2>
</div>


<p>It is in place to state that the affair was the termination
of one of the most picturesque incidents of the entire war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">Oct. 9, '62</span>

On the 9th of October, Confederate General Stuart with
eighteen hundred of the best mounted and most reliable
men in the brigades of Wade Hampton, Fitz Hugh Lee
and B. H. Robertson started from Darksville, a place some
miles above Martinsburg in the valley of the Shenandoah
and, moving northward, crossed the Potomac at McCoy's
Ford and reached Chambersburg, Penn., in the evening
of the 10th. In the Keystone State the troopers had helped
themselves to whatever they chose to take, but they had
carefully refrained from molesting property on their way
through Maryland. In Chambersburg and vicinity, horses
and whatever might contribute to the welfare and comfort
of the invaders were appropriated. The night in the Pennsylvania
city was spent in drizzling rain which added not a
little to the peril of the situation, for Federal authorities
were astir, hoping to surround and capture the entire rebel
outfit. The morning of the 11th, the horsemen turned
their steps eastward, proceeding towards Gettysburg as
far as Cashtown; thence the route was directly southward,
through Emmitsburg, New Market, Hyattstown, etc.,
with only momentary halts, to the Potomac. There was
no bivouac for the night, since any hour might confront
the riders with a Union force to effectually block their way.
Stuart had the good fortune to be guided by Capt. B. S.
White, a Poolesville man and a member of his staff who
knew the entire country thoroughly, so that, while the
Federal forces were looking for the enemy further down the
stream or at points higher up, White piloted them to the
ford and saw them in safety on the other side.</p>

<p>It was one of the great events of military history;
General Stoneman with infantry and cavalry was stationed
at Poolesville, and Pleasanton was in readiness at the
mouth of the Monocacy, places which the astute Confederates
carefully avoided. The net results of the expedition
were the destruction of public and railroad property in
Chambersburg to the amount of two hundred and fifty
thousand dollars; two hundred and eighty wounded and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
sick prisoners, paroled; thirty United States government
officials and other citizens of prominence, captured and
forwarded to Richmond, to be held as hostages for Confederate
citizens held by the North, and more than twelve hundred
horses brought away to replenish the mounts for the
daring rebels. Within twenty-seven hours, the Confederates
had ridden ninety miles, encumbered with artillery and
captured horses, and had forced the final passage of the
Potomac virtually under the very eyes of the Union forces,
their only loss being two men who wandered away, and
the only casualty was the wounding of one man. Not a
few observers in the Union ranks wondered why things
were thus, and Hooker's pertinent question, "Who ever
saw a dead cavalryman?" is remembered.</p>

<p>An interesting postscript to the escape of Stuart and his
men came about soon after when Poole and Leslie of Company
K, in spite of the strict orders as to watchfulness
and care, laid off their clothes, when on picket, and swam
over to Harrison's Island where they found no other rebel
than an old mule, feeding in solitary, but on their way back
they found in the river a pair of saddle-bags that had belonged
to the Chaplain of Hampton's Legion, one of Stuart's
force, and evidently lost in the crossing. The contents
consisted in pious tracts, a vest with Confederate buttons,
needles and thread, and a hospital flag, a yellow cotton
affair, which years afterward would be one of the finder's
choicest relics. Leslie was always very sorry that those
tracts were not distributed among the Johnnies, for he
thought they needed them badly.</p>

<p>The same rain that had made the rebel raid all the more
difficult rendered the return of our men to camp very uncomfortable,
but they had learned something of what might
be expected of them. Besides, during the evening they
acquired a bit of military knowledge from certain troops
under Gen. D. B. Birney of the Corps, lately commanded
by Gen. Phil Kearney. They too had come in a hurry
from Hall's Hill and found themselves too late for the game.</p>

It had been a hard day and the men were tired and hungry;
flocking over to the camp of the Thirty-ninth, they were
cordially received and the Massachusetts men generously
gave what they could to the comfort of the weary soldiers,
receiving in payment many thanks and some pretty large
stories of the fights in which the older soldiers had been.
One of the latter's first acts was to build great fires, using
therefor the fence rails, hitherto untouched by the Bay
State lads, this being in conformity with orders, but the
experienced campaigners cared not a copper for rules, but
speedily laid hold on the combustible matter and lighted
roaring fires that astonished the lately arrived. Such
desecration was not to be tamely endured by those who
strictly interpreted the law, so the colonel of the Thirty-ninth
undertook to stay the hands of the wet and muddy
soldiers and thus to save the fences, but the veterans of the
Peninsula, Groveton and Antietam were not to be diverted
by mere language, and the conflagration continued till
long lengths of zigzag fence had disappeared.</p>

    <h2>MOVING AGAIN</h2>
</div>


<p>Tuesday, the 14th of October, saw the regiment again
in line, and marching something like eight miles towards
Washington to Seneca Landing, camping there for the night.
The land was low and wet near the canal, and in the morning
all turned out as wet as if they had been in the rain, so
dense was the fog that overspread the locality. By morning's
light, a new camping-place was found on a high hill,
half a mile to the rear, where camp was once more pitched,
the Sibley tents having arrived; the location was the same
that was occupied by the Second Massachusetts Infantry
in the winter of 1861 and 2; the Landing, about twenty-five
miles from Washington, was at the mouth of Seneca
Creek and was a depot of supplies for the army. A noteworthy
arrival of mail is chronicled for this place, since in
the maneuvers of the last few days, a large quantity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
such matter had accumulated at Poolesville and it is recorded
that fully eight bushels of letters and papers were
distributed among the men, hungry for news from home.
Hitherto, the Thirty-ninth had acted in an independent
capacity, but on Friday, the 17th, orders were promulgated,
organizing a brigade, to be under the command of Brigadier
Gen. Cuvier Grover and to consist of the Thirty-ninth,
the Tenth Vermont, the Fourteenth New Hampshire and
the Twenty-third Maine along with a battery and certain
cavalry, the same being an independent brigade, though
under the ultimate command of General Heintzelman, who
was in charge of the defenses of Washington, the duties
being similar to those hitherto performed.</p>

<p>During these days, while there were drills, inspections
and other camp duties, the enlisted man had time, or he
took it, to visit neighboring farms, to quiz the natives, to
sample the products of the land and in many ways to prove
his derivation from Yankeedom. The men found the negroes
glad to see them and ready to hurrah for the flag, while
suspicion was generally harbored that professions of loyalty
on the part of slave-owners were not particularly sincere.
Target shoots were indulged in, a practice of which there
should have been more throughout the army; Sunday,
the 19th, was remarked as quite uneventful, since there
were only inspections and dress parade, and no alarm of
any sort. October 20th orders came to pack up, and a
removal to the mouth of Muddy Branch was made,
possibly three miles nearer Washington, where the old
routine was continued. As the name of the stream would
indicate, the locality was still very unhealthy, being low
and damp, but the duties were less arduous when on picket,
through there being less posts and less hours of duty.
Illicit traffic with the enemy had to be strictly watched and
prevented.</p>

<p>On the 21st, a long stretch of embankment on the canal
breaking away, a detachment of five men from each company
was made to proceed to the scene, some three miles

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">Oct. 21, '62</span>

down the stream, and to repair the same, an employment
hardly contemplated when they enlisted. However, they
succeeded in stopping the crevasse and permitting the
renewal of transportation. Though comparatively near
the base of supplies, provisions at times were scarce and
hardtack and water seemed scant rations for men accustomed
to more generous fare. If, under such circumstances,
soldiers foraged occasionally, sometimes paying for what
they got, more often not, why, it was only a part of the
game that the North and the South were playing; and to
prove themselves rapidly progressing, October 24th, ostensibly
in retaliation for excessive charges, a raid was made
on the regimental sutler,<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> mulcting his assets to the amount,
so said, of about eighty dollars.</p>

<p>The section guarded by the Thirty-ninth and the other
regiments of the brigade, being on the canal and river, was
one pretty thoroughly traversed by the Union soldiers and
those who kept diaries made many interesting entries.
There was a constant passing of boats on the canal and
all roads led to Washington. Negroes on their way to the
Nation's Capital might be intercepted, but if the black
man asserted that he was running away from his master,
he would have been a rare soldier who would turn him
back. One colored person, thus halted, very aged, claimed
to have been a slave of General Washington and, in reply
to a query, said that the Father of his Country looked very
brave. Though situated on the top of a hill, the constant
wet weather made the surroundings of the camp anything
but agreeable, the soil being soft and sticky; to crown
all misfortunes, occasionally a tent would collapse upon
its occupants in the midst of rain and wind, resulting in

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>

hurried action on the part of the unfortunate fellows who
may have just come in from the exactions of a prolonged
tour of picket duty.</p>

<p>Lucky was the man on picket when the last day of
October rolled round, for on this date there were inspections
and waitings in line, armed cap-a-pie, sometimes at
a "shoulder arms," drills, reviews and a muster for pay.
Everything seemingly that could be rung into a day's
work was had. Perhaps the fact that the muster for pay
covered two months of service was as agreeable an exercise
as the day afforded. It was during these days that
at least one company, possibly more, undertook to repeat
the game so nicely played by Birney's veterans when they
camped near the Thirty-ninth at the time of Stuart's crossing
the Potomac; in other words, representatives of the
companies, under supposed proper orders and directed by
sergeants, went out some distance from camp and secured
a good supply of well dried fence rails for the use of the
company cooks in the preparation of food. The matter
was thought quite proper, until the men were ordered
into line and compelled to pick up what rails had not already
been chopped into firewood and to carry them back to the
place where they were obtained, though in depositing them
the soldiers surely raised a sign of offense before the doors
of the parties making complaint. Somehow the men could
not be made to appreciate the tender manner in which
some in authority thought the residents should be treated.</p>

<p>While each day brought its regular round of duty, there
was little of novelty in successive days, the soldiers gradually
hardening into the restraints and exactions of camp
life. The 7th of November brought the first snow fall of the
season, and though only about two inches of the fleecy
reminder of northern regions fell, it was enough to impart
a robe of whiteness to Mother Earth and boys-in-blue had
the pleasure of snow-balling while it lasted, which was
scarcely more than twenty-four hours. The 9th was Sunday
and it brought the regular inspections, though the rain

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">Nov. 11, '62</span>

and cold prevented religious service and dress parade. The
cold was severe enough to freeze liquids left by the occupants
in their tents while out on duty. Monday, the 10th,
marked a brigade inspection by General Grover, which
the men inspected voted much easier than those made by
their Colonel. This was the last appearance of General
Grover in the brigade since on the 11th he was ordered to
report to General N. P. Banks, who was organizing reinforcements
for the Department of the Gulf. A native of
Maine and a graduate of West Point, 1850, he had won
honors at Williamsburg, Fair Oaks and at the Second Bull
Run. As commander of a division in the Nineteenth
Army Corps he will win still further laurels both in the
extreme South and in the Valley of the Shenandoah. His
independent brigade had grown to respect him highly.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter">
    <h2>OFFUTT'S CROSS ROADS</h2>
</div>


<p>The departure of General Grover was followed by the
assignment of Colonel Davis to the command of the brigade
and the elevation of Lieut. Colonel Peirson to that of the
regiment. In close connection with the foregoing, a change
of location was ordered by General Heintzelman and, on
the 13th, another move towards Washington was effected.
Turning out long before daylight, an early breakfast was
eaten and the line of march was begun before sunrise, the
terminal being Offutt's Cross Roads, some twelve or more
miles from Washington, the crossed roads being that from
Rockville to Great Falls, and the turnpike which paralleled
the river and canal, terminating at Tennallytown. There
was a deal of grubbing out of stumps and other obstacles
necessary in providing for a parade ground, though the
site was considered better than the one just left, even if
there was no adequate supply of water near. All the other
regiments in the brigade were camped close by, viz.: the
Tenth Vermont, the Fourteenth New Hampshire, and the
Twenty-third Maine. In honor of the retiring brigade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
commander, the new stopping place was named Camp
Grover.</p>

<p>In diaries of the period two quite diverse entries are
found for the 15th, one stating that Colonel Davis, acting
brigade commander, was thrown from his horse, though
fortunately he was not seriously hurt; the other that the
band of the Fourteenth New Hampshire played "Home
Sweet Home" so beautifully that it made a wave of homesickness
sweep over and through the brigade. A company
from each regiment in the brigade was sent out by Colonel
Davis to look after some of Captain White's guerrillas.
A distressing accident was that of the 17th when James
W. Finn of Company I, only eighteen years old, a farmer
boy of Natick, fell from the containing wall of the canal-lock
into the water and was drowned. During these days,
the men were learning how to make their tents warmer
through a system of stockading, and there was need enough
of it, since cold weather had begun. Of all the regiments,
there is a large representation in the hospitals, though the
Thirty-ninth is better off in this respect than the others.
However the best is bad enough, for on the 21st Charles
H. Morrison of the Natick company passed on, followed
on the 22d by Sumner P. Rollins of Somerville, a young
man of eighteen years. Again on the 23rd, two more men
of "I" crossed over, George L. Fogg and Francis E. Mann,
and on the 25th, died Francis E. Newhall, also of Natick.
Hugh Connoly of the Woburn company died November
25th. In the five weeks' stay at this point, the Tenth Vermont
lost twenty-five men, their funeral marches through
the camp being of almost daily occurrence.</p>

<p>Two and a half miles from the canal, at or near Great
Falls, where begins the aqueduct which carries Washington's
water supply, a considerable portion of these soldiers'
duty was the guarding of the Government buildings there,
including a bakery; near by was a large freestone quarry
whose product was utilized in the building of the reservoir
and the aqueduct itself. Considering the rain, which was

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">Nov. 27, '62</span>

very prevalent, and the mud which deepened on little provocation,
the distance seemed to grow as the days advanced.
On the 24th two companies were sent off in a hurry to intercept
some of Stuart's cavalry said to be in the vicinity of
Edward's Ferry; nothing came of the effort more important
than the capture of two negroes. There was little going
on that did not involve the colored man more or less. Even
Mr. Offutt, for whom the cross roads are named, had been
in the Old Capitol Prison because of his inability to render
up one of his slaves when called for by General Jas. S.
Wadsworth, when the latter was military governor of the
District of Columbia.</p>

<p>November 27th was Thanksgiving Day at home, possibly
the most generally observed day in New England. For
several preceding days there had been a steady stream of
packages from the homeland, indicative of the appreciation
in which every soldier was held somewhere. Of course
these boxes and bundles contained articles of comfort both
for internal and external use. The approach of the day
on which the Governor and State Secretary unite in "God
Save the Commonwealth" brought out many expressions
of wonder among the soldiers as to how the day would or
could pass without something unusual in the way of food.
The care and foresight of the home-army supplied the
answer to the query, whether expressed or not, and though
there was no general table around which the hundreds
gathered, in some way it was possible for the greater portion
of the men to feel that the day had its special significance
even if they were far from home. Company K, which
hailed from Woburn, was especially well served, and the
display of boxes and other receptacles in the company
street excited no little admiration, not to say envy, in the
minds of some not so well provided for. It is stated that
even fluids, particularly interdicted, were smuggled through
some of the packages, notwithstanding the thorough search
of the captain, and specimens of Northern distillations
were submitted to that officer's approval. From that date,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
"canned tomatoes" acquired a new distinction. There
was a release from the greater part of camp duties and the
time thus secured was devoted to baseball, football and
the other diversions so easily devised by the American
youth.</p>

<p>A feature of the Thanksgiving spread, possibly not
wholly understood at the time, came out subsequently
when the "boys" learned how much work their pleasure
had cost others. C. F. Whitney of Company I was serving
as wagoner, and the night before the 27th, soon after "Taps,"
he was aroused by the wagon-master with the statement
that there was no hardbread for the men, that the morrow
brought Thanksgiving; he ordered Whitney to proceed to
the Canal Locks, about three miles away, and with the
commissary sergeant get a load of 'tack. Having worked
hard all day, Whitney naturally demurred, but he had to
comply, so he harnessed his six mules, took in Sergeant
Hilton and started on his night ride. It was after 10 o'clock,
the sergeant went to sleep at once on a bed of bags in the
bottom of the wagon, but no such comfort attended the
driver who, in his saddle on the wheel-mule, had to look
after things. About halfway to his destination, he had to
pass through a stretch of always muddy road, now actually
overflowing with water, so deep in places that he had
to take his feet from the stirrups to keep them dry. Night
work of late had fallen to Whitney's lot, hence he was
sleepy to the point of actually dozing off while in the saddle,
this of course, after getting through the morass, and from
this semi-sleeping state he was suddenly roused with the cry
of "halt," uttered seemingly by a dozen voices. With as
many bayonets pointed at his breast, his first thought was
of "Johnnies," but he put on a bold front and shouted,
"Let the mules alone, I can handle them myself." He
would not tell them where he was going neither would he
give the countersign, because he had none, nor had there
been any picket-line along the way before. All this time
the sergeant had slept on in his cosy bed, but he was roused

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">Nov.-Dec., '62</span>

and proved equally ignorant of the password. It seemed
that the Tenth Vermont, camped near, had just established
a picket-post at the place, and the men were acting according
to instructions; much to the disgust of the two men
of the Thirty-ninth they were compelled to turn about and
return to their camp; nor did their troubles end there for,
having cared for his animals and being on the point of turning
in himself, the quartermaster again informed the driver
and the sergeant that they would have to go back for that
load of 'tack. So back they went, mules, mud and all, and
with the countersign, getting by the Green Mountain boys,
they reached the canal boat which they found having a
great pile of Thanksgiving boxes from the North; wisely
choosing these instead of the hardbread, they took the
offerings to camp, reaching the same just after reveillé,
and had no trouble in unloading; and this is how the regiment
got its spread for Thanksgiving.</p>

<p>The remainder of November and the beginning of December
had no special variants from the recent routine of
drill, police and picket duty, though the scribe of Company
K makes mention of the formation of a "construction
corps" from a portion of that company, the object being
the erection and equipping of a structure which should be
used as a bath-house and a barber-shop. The labor essential
to the cutting down of the necessary timber, the transportation
to camp and its preparation there for use, absorbed
the time and attention of a large number of men, who welcomed
a relief from the constant round of drill with its
endless repetition of facings, pacings and flank-movements,
though the work performed was by no means light. At
the same time increased labor fell on those who were obliged
to perform the picket, sentinel, guard and other
duties which were incessant. In the night of the 14th, a
party of rebel raiders surprised in Poolesville a detachment
of Scott's Nine Hundred, a New York Cavalry regiment,
resulting in the capture of a number of the Union
soldiers, with the death of one and the wounding of others.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
The place being so near the earlier camps of the Thirty-ninth,
on or near the Potomac, the men were not surprised
at increased vigilance in the placing of pickets all along
the interval between the Cross Roads and the Leesburg
pike. An observer in Company B says for this day,
"Buried one of our men by the name of Hiedenway (David),
the first one in our company."</p>

<p>During these days, news from the terrible battle of
Fredericksburg began to filter into the camp, at first very
favorable for the Union side and then the awful truth came
in all of its horrors. Our men of the Thirty-ninth had
brothers and friends by the hundreds in the Bay State
regiments that suffered there, the news, by no means,
making easier the duties of the guardsmen along the Potomac.
The weather was cold and any proposition to move
from the well established camp was exceedingly unpopular,
but just such intimation came in the evening of the 20th,
when orders were received to be ready to march. The boy
who wrote in his diary "We have just got nicely settled
for winter" learned, ere he was many months older, that
wars are not conducted on the basis of being comfortable.
The four regiments of the brigade were in line by nine o'clock
in the morning of the 21st. Fortunately the weather was
fine and the start was made, with music by the band, and
six of the miles were marched, before the halt was made
for the preparation of dinner. As Poolesville, the destination,
is about twenty miles away from the Cross Roads
(Offutt's) there yet remained a deal of walking to be done.
With all of their camp belongings, over the frozen ground,
the distance seemed greater than it really was.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter">
    <h2>POOLESVILLE</h2>
</div>


<p>It was after dark, 6 o'clock on the evening, when the
village was reached. Once a fairly prosperous Southern
town, Poolesville revealed at this time a sorry spectacle of

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">Dec. 21, '62</span>

the ravages of war. Many of the men had straggled, unable
to keep the pace of the hard march and only about one-fifth
of the entire body arrived with the colors, but the
delinquents limped loyally in, though late. Accommodations
for the night had to be found wherever available,
the village church holding many, the schoolhouse others;
many found shelter in barns and not a few sought sleep on
fence rails whose native hardness was softened a bit by
straw obtained from a nearby strawstack, though its complete
demolition was prevented by those soldiers who had
managed to burrow into it. A sergeant of Company E who
kept a small quantity of "commissary" for medicinal purposes
had entrusted the precious flask to the keeping of
John Locke, the most likely member to be faithful to his
trust. Alas, when the sergeant called for the flask he got
it empty, the contents had gone to help dry the thoroughly
saturated comrades of Locke, who thought the boys would
never have greater need. While in the morning of the 22d,
some of the regiment were detailed for picket at Edward's
Ferry, more remained in the village. Some of Scott's Nine
Hundred, the regiment that had suffered from White's
guerrillas about a week before, chose this day as one for
wreaking vengeance on certain storekeepers, one of them
Jesse Higgins by name, these natives being suspected of
complicity with the enemy. The goods of the merchants
were thrown out regardless and the lucky soldiers who
chanced to be near helped themselves to whatever they
liked best, though Companies B, H and K, being at the
Ferry, missed their share of the wreckage. In Poolesville
were thus halted the Thirty-ninth and the Fourteenth
New Hampshire; the Tenth Vermont went further up the
river and the Twenty-third Maine found its post lower
down.</p>

<p>Duty along the Potomac was not unlike that performed
some weeks before, but in the interval these men had learned
a deal; not only had they been drilled but they had observed
that all of the people resident in the vicinity were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
not wholly loyal, that many of them were ready to pass
the desired word along to the enemy whenever opportunity
offered, and for such reasons they determined to piece
out their own rations with whatever was obtainable from
the citizens. Nothing that was edible and transportable
was safe from the predatory hands of the men and boys
who, a very few months before, had been conspicuous
in their own localities for their sterling honesty and straightforwardness.
War and so-called necessity worked wonderful
transformations in these well reared New Englanders.
If all the stories that have been told in subsequent years
may be believed, the marvel is that the natives had anything
left to subsist upon. December 23rd brought the
camp-stores and equipage by way of the canal, and a large
force was set at work cutting away trees to make ready
for the new camp. The site chosen for the camp was that
on which the regiment had halted at the end of its first
considerable march, that from Arlington in the preceding
September. A large detail of men from the several companies,
not on picket, worked hard through Wednesday
the 27th, to properly pitch the tents and so collect the
men into camp once more.</p>

<p>Of course the 25th of December came to Camp Davis,
the name of the new winter quarters, just as it did to the
rest of the world, but signs of Christmas were painfully
lacking. One youth made this record, "To-day is Christmas;
four of us went out of the lines and got a Christmas
dinner and had it charged to Uncle Sam." Furnishing
food to Union soldiers in those parts must have been like a
lottery with the chances against getting anything back.
Said another observer, "Christmas day! And we would
not know it by the work going on in camp; dined on salt
beef, more commonly known as 'salt-horse'." The later
days of the month were devoted to properly equipping
the camp which, for location, was the best yet occupied
except for wood and water, the latter having to be brought
fully half a mile, and the former was two miles off. For

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">Dec. 28, '62</span>

purposes of drill the parade ground was unexcelled and
was extensive enough to admit of the maneuvers of an entire
division at one time. Once more the Sibley tents are
stockaded and the men believe that winter quarters are
really realized. In the light of later years, the occupants
of that camp claim that there was no better in the entire
army. Though located on a level plain, it was so well
drained that no amount of rain was able to render it disagreeable
underfoot, a fact which no doubt contributed
to the prevailing health of the men.</p>

<p>On Sunday, the 28th, as the men were falling in for inspection,
their eyes were gladdened by the sight of the
Tenth Massachusetts Battery, subsequently known to
fame as "Sleepers," approaching Camp Davis. This event
is thus cheerfully alluded to in John D. Billing's excellent
history of the Battery, "'How are you, Boxford?' was the
greeting from the Thirty-ninth Regiment, as soon as we
were recognized, and it seemed like meeting old friends to
fall in with those who had been encamped with us on the
soil of Massachusetts." It was a strange stroke of fortune
that should bring these Boxford neighbors again so near
to each other, for the battery was assigned to the brigade
and found a camping place close by. This day, too, brought
to the ears of many, for the first time since leaving Massachusetts,
the sound of a church bell, but it was not for these
soldiers, who were still perfecting themselves in the school
of the soldier; lessons so well learned that the Thirty-ninth
stood second to none in discipline and soldierly appearance,
and better still in general health, conditions largely due to
the unceasing diligence of the Colonel, with whom drill
seemed to be the chief end of man, especially those wearing
uniforms. Long before daylight in the morning of the
30th, an alarm brought the men into line and four companies
of the Thirty-ninth with a single section of Sleeper's
Battery started off towards Conrad's Ferry where, as usual,
a crossing of the rebels was reported. In light marching
order, over the most difficult of roads, the party hastened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
to the scene, as supposed, of trouble. Though there were
the reaching of an island in the river by means of a boat
and a certain amount of fortifying, nothing came of the
affair and at 1 p. m., tired and hungry the return trip was
begun, ending at 4 o'clock, with every one out of conceit
with military movements. On the last day in the month
the Regiment was mustered for two months' pay, always
a welcome exercise.</p>

<div class="chapter">
    <h2>1863</h2>
</div>


<p>The new year was ushered in on Thursday, and the prevailing
sentiment among the men is indicated by this entry
in his diary by one who evidently had entertained other
opinions, "The boys are rather blue on the war subject;
they begin to think they will not get home in the spring."
Very few soldiers had any idea of the many long and weary
months before them. The first men who went out, the
Three Months' Men, thought it hardly possible that it
would take all of their projected term to wipe out the
Rebellion, nor were the rebels any less in error in their
estimate of the duration of the conflict. In the middle
of the month, the same writer once more reflects thus,
"Our hopes of getting home in the spring are somewhat
blighted," yet he and his comrades attended strictly to
duty just the same. As the month progressed, the men had
full opportunity to size up and adequately estimate the
village near which they were encamped. Like everything
that ever fell under the blighting hand of slavery, it exhibited
a lack of paint and enterprise. Poor Richard long
since remarked that he who by the plow would thrive must
either hold himself or drive. In the South the slave-owner
did neither; superintendence was entrusted to the
overseer and what work was done, the slave did. How well
this was accomplished, the surroundings showed. It has
been said that there were only two loyal men in the village,
Mr. Metzger, the postmaster; and Dr. Brace. Under such

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">Jan. 2, '63</span>

conditions there need be little wonder that the Yankee
boys thought it no sin to spoil the Egyptians.</p>

<p>It was in the night of the 2nd that some vagrant members
of Scott's Nine Hundred, that redoubtable New York
cavalry body, which in December had cleaned out Higgins'
store, came back to do it again. On guard was F. R. W.
Hall of Company F whose brother, Eben A., was performing
similar duty in a neighboring building. "Whiskey"
was the battle cry of the New Yorkers and they sailed in
to wreck things. At first, to oppose them, was only "A
little red-headed guard" and they soon found that that
<em>Hall</em> could neither be hired nor scared, though he was
extremely happy to find soon at his side the brother,
supposed to be in another place. Both boys were "Sons
of Temperance" and they proved to the rummies that, once
at least, prohibition prohibited, for the Halls managed to
keep the mob out till Lieutenant Paul appeared with the
reserve guard; even then the raiders did not subside, for
they formed under their leader preparatory to a fight.
Not having their cavalry outfit with them, they gave way
to discretion, always the better part of valor; and all the
more readily when Lieutenant Paul gave the order to
charge, and they rapidly disappeared in the darkness.
They had succeeded in smashing all of the windows, however,
and almost unroofing Hall, whose gory scalp was proclaimed
the first case of bloodshed for the Regiment.
Though Higgins might have been a rebel, he doubtless was,
the boys were set to protect and they always obeyed orders.</p>

<p>The 5th of January beheld the return of Colonel Davis
to the Regiment, the command of the brigade devolving
on Col. A. B. Jewett, of the Tenth Vermont, who after all
these weeks had discovered that his commission antedated
that of our Colonel just one day and there were people
so uncharitable as to intimate that he had had the
document redated just for this special purpose. Though
there may have been those who did not altogether love
Colonel Davis, because of his excessive devotion to drill,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
and the rigors of a soldier's life, all were as one in their
admiration of his military bearing and his fitness for the
head of the brigade, while his successor was notably lacking
in all such characteristics. The Colonel made his first
reappearance at dress parade and was greeted with a
round of hearty cheers. In the evening he was honored by
the Regiment's gathering round his quarters, accompanied
by the band of the Fourteenth New Hampshire. The
serenade prompted the officer to make a very happy speech,
thanking everybody for progress in the past and urging a
continuance in the same commendable direction. That
the head of the Regiment was deeply interested in the welfare
of his command was evident to every man.</p>

<p>The month was not entirely devoid of interest and the
sham-battle between the battery and a portion of Scott's
Nine Hundred (Eleventh New York Cavalry), on the 6th,
roused the admiration of all onlookers to a high pitch; the
rapid firing of the guns and the shouts of the charging
cavalry gave the boys a notion of what the real thing must
be, an impression rendered all the more vivid by the accidental
wounding of several of the combatants, through
premature discharges and too close proximity of certain
ones. The endless round of all sorts of drill was rendered
less irksome by the remembrance of those at home who
were constantly sending choice bits of food for the delectation
of their dear ones in the field and, to crown all, on the
17th, came seventeen barrels of apples for the Woburn
company, right from the town that had first produced the
famous Baldwin apple, and the generosity of the "K"
boys was unstinted in distributing their pomological treasures
among their less fortunate friends. Sunday, the 18th,
some three hundred or more of the men repaired to the
Presbyterian Church for religious service, expecting to
hear the Chaplain, but in his stead, Private Batcheller,
one of the older members of Company B, preached, a fact
well illustrating the diversity of talent among American
soldiers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Jan. 20, '63</div>

<p>The "knapsack-drill" of January 20th has lodgement in
the minds of many, the Colonel ordering that the 1 p. m.
company drill be executed in heavy marching order. Considerable
growling and grumbling were heard in the progress
of the duty, and at its end Companies F and G gave
three rousing cheers for "knapsack-drill," an act that
roused the ire of the officer so that the companies were
ordered on an hour's drill without cessation. At the end
of the battalion-drill, the Regiment was formed in solid
square and Colonel Davis very clearly explained to the
men his reasons for the heavy task imposed, dwelling on his
mortification at the episode of the morning. He said that
whatever had been done as yet, it was only a prelude to
what must follow and he desired the men to become inured
to fatigue through such exercises as those of the earlier
hour, concluding his words by the remark that if they would
act like men, they would receive corresponding usage from
him. The next three days were marked by a very severe
rain storm; tents went down before it, and the sheds for
the stalling of the wagon-train mules, some one hundred and
thirty in number, fell in upon the animals. Covered with
straw, and saturated with rain, the burden became too
great and the calamity followed, luckily not to the fatal
injury of any of the beasts. The 25th being Sunday, it is
recorded that some of the men went to prayer meeting and
that in the afternoon the Chaplain preached, though his
auditors were chiefly from Company A, the one in which
he had enlisted. Of the 29th and 30th, it is told that a
snow storm that would have befitted Vermont or New
Hampshire raged, much to the discomfort of those on
guard, while others had not only to clear the company street
but to free the parade ground for brigade inspection, the
same coming on the afternoon of the 31st and being conducted
by Col. Robert Wilson, of the Fourteenth New
Hampshire, Colonel Davis acting Brigadier-General, in
the absence of Colonel Jewett.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>February proved to be a stormy month, severe snow
storms reminding the men of the climate at home, but
guard rounds had to be maintained, no matter what the
weather might be. On Monday, the 2nd, a battalion of
the Sixth Michigan Cavalry, Major Kenyon, appeared,
and became a part of the local Union force. Armed with
the very latest of breechloading carbines, they had every
sign of ability to put up a good fight with whatever foe
the future might develop. Very likely no event of the
month gave the soldiers any more enjoyment than the
coming of the paymaster on the 6th, with the money that
the Regiment had been looking for so long and anxiously.
"He took us all by surprise," says one writer, "coming on
the grounds at 3 p. m., with his four-horse team." While
a considerable part of the sum received went into the tills
of local dealers and of the sutler, by far the larger part
was sent home for the comfort of loved ones there, Company
K sending thus fully $2300. The payment was only
to the first of November, and it was the first coming of the
dispenser of Uncle Sam's compensation since leaving Massachusetts.
He was employed two days in passing out the
money.</p>

<p>One of the episodes of this snowy Poolesville winter
was the effort that a certain notable member of Company &mdash;&mdash; made
to get out of the army. On account of a certain
grievance, real or fancied, he simulated insanity so perfectly
that there was a pretty general agreement that he
had lost his head. Having committed to memory the entire
contents of the American First Class Reader, he would
station himself in the middle of the parade ground and in
the stillness of the night hours declaim from the reader;
even Colonel Davis began to think his man had lost his
reason. Had the soldier stopped here or had his readiness
to say a good thing, regardless of consequences, been under
better control, his ruse probably would have succeeded.
In the system of rigid camp neatness, a barrel for night
refuse was provided for every company, to be carried off

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">Feb., '63</span>

each morning; to the increased astonishment of his comrades
our declaimer now added fishing to his pranks and
most soberly bobbed for bites in the filthy liquid. Finally
Colonel Davis, after watching the performance from the
tent of a company officer, approached the fisherman and
asked what he was doing. "Fishing, sir," was the sober
reply. "What do you expect to catch?" says the Colonel;
"My discharge, sir." It was there that the man fell down,
but he never could resist the temptation to make an apt
reply. Plenty of hard work soon restored the orator and
emulator of Izaak Walton to all of his normal senses and to
becoming a model soldier.</p>

<p>During these days a strange rumor gained credence, viz.,
that the Regiment, with the Fortieth and Forty-first was to
be assigned to the nine months' quota, the Government
having found that the State had exceeded its three years'
allotment by three regiments. If the origin of such insane
propositions could be ascertained a great boon would be
conferred upon humanity, since many a man found himself
most grievously disappointed when the whole affair
was recognized as an illusion. A great snow storm began
on the 17th, and for twenty-four hours raged fiercely, changing
finally into rain, which effectually removed what otherwise
would have occasioned many a backache; the men
counted the time well spent in checkers, cards and other
camp diversions, in place of regular drill. It was a sorry
time though for those on guard. The 20th brought pleasure
to the quarters of Colonel Davis, for, on this day, his wife
came to pay him a visit. Washington's birthday brought
another old fashioned storm of wind and snow, testing
fully the texture and endurance of the Sibley tents; fuel
was scarce also, and, orders to the contrary notwithstanding,
neighboring fence rails found their way into the fireplaces,
thus giving a measure of comfort to the shivering occupants.
The only official notice of the day was the firing of a salute
by Sleeper's Battery, thirty-four guns, the report of which
could hardly be heard above the roar of the storm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as the storm abated there was the usual heavy
detail of men from the several companies for the purpose of
clearing the streets and parade ground, the wisdom of such
procedure had, by this time, become apparent to the men,
since they could go about their several duties dry shod, while
neighboring regiments plodded with wet feet through the
slush and mud which followed the disappearance of the
rapidly melting snow. Experience and observation are
the best of teachers. A very pleasant instance of camp
amenities was exhibited in this month, when First Sergeant
Oscar Persons, of Company K, having been promoted to
a second Lieutenancy and assigned to Company D, was
presented by his late comrades with the equipments essential
to his new position. The presentation was made by
Lieutenant Wyman, and the recipient very happily
responded. The ever obliging band of the Fourteenth New
Hampshire accompanied the men on their errand of love,
and discoursed music fitting to the occasion. The month
ended with the bi-monthly muster for pay, the same making
the Government just four months in arrears.</p>

<p>March will not be much, if any, improvement on the preceding
month. The demand for fuel to supply heat for
cooking and also for rendering the tents comfortable makes
it necessary for details to go further and further from camp,
and it is very fortunate that so much of the country has
been allowed to grow up to forests. All men have to take
their portion of the chopping exercise and in the performance
of all camp duties. Possibly there was some abatement
in drill on account of the weather and consequent
condition of the grounds, and if the wearied soldiers were
allowed a little more time in quarters, they accounted it
no real loss. Pertaining to the variable character of the
March weather, and illustrative of certain most admirable
racial characteristics, Abijah Thompson, of "K," tells the
story of a certain Irishman among the Woburn boys, the
very best natured lad in the company, who was on guard
duty in the midst of one of the hardest downpours of that

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">March 17, '63</span>

torrential period. The weather, however, made no difference
with Colonel Davis, for his regular rounds were made,
rain or shine; when he neared Patrick the latter faced the
officer, presented arms and said, "Good marnin, Kurnel!
It's a foin mornin' this, if wan't for the rain." 'Tis said
the Colonel laughed so hard he almost fell off his horse.
Both February and March witnessed a steady coming
into the lines of rebel soldiers, really deserters, whom it
was necessary to escort down to the City of Washington.
To serve on the squad which thus guarded the men-in-gray
to the Capital was considered to be a privilege. Also in
this month, the authorities pursuing their investigations
determined that several so-called Union citizens of the
vicinity were really sympathizers with the South, and for
such reasons a Mr. Pleasants and Colonel Leonards were
arrested and sent to the old Capital prison.</p>

<p>The 17th was "house cleaning" day and, the tents having
been removed from the stockades and everything carried
out, the spaces were carefully inspected by the surgeon,
the lieut. colonel and Captain J. Henry Sleeper of the Battery;
the report of the officers was very complimentary to
the Regiment. Whatever the coincidence, the event had no
connection with the British evacuation of Boston nor with
St. Patrick's day. The two months were notable in the
number of furloughs that officers and men obtained for
trips back to Massachusetts, not long ones, but sufficient
for a taste of home comforts and a sight of the dear ones
there. The month ended with the severest storm of the
season, the snow falling in great quantities, but at the period
of the equinox, snow cannot be expected to remain a very
great while and it departed more rapidly than it came. An
observer on the spot wrote thus in his journal for the 31st,
"Woke up and found the ground covered with snow; realization
of the sunny South is very different from what I had
fancied it."</p>

<p>April found the Thirty-ninth still in its Poolesville camp,
that is, when its members were not out on picket and other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
duties, the same extending a long way up as well as down
the Potomac. The weather was as variable as ever, a mixture
of good, bad and indifferent, yet through it all the
regiment maintained a fair condition of health. "Many
jokes and sells, for it was All Fools' Day," was the entry
in a certain diary for the first day of the month, and what
nonsense a thousand men of military age could not devise
on such an occasion, it would be difficult to imagine. The
2d was the regular New England Fast Day, and a holiday
was proclaimed by the Colonel, for which he received the
mental if not verbal thanks of all the "boys" who proceeded
to enjoy the day to the limit. Probably as large a
proportion of the regiment attended the religious services
at 11 a. m., conducted by Chaplain French, as were present
at similar exercises at home churches in distant Massachusetts.
However this may have been, there was no
failure in taking part in the races, sparring-matches and
various games, or at least witnessing them. The baseball
game was between the men of Sleeper's Battery and those
selected from the Thirty-ninth with the honors remaining
with the Infantry, though the cannoniers were supposed
to be particularly skillful in the throwing of balls.</p>

<p>The 5th of April found the ground again covered with a
heavy fall of snow, and though it departed quickly it left
a deal of mud and discomfort generally. The roads and
by-paths were not so well drained as the grounds of our
Bay State regiment. Thanks to the careful annalist, we
know that the new bakery was in working order on the
8th and that the first batch of bread was to be baked that
night. Too bad that it had not come earlier or that any
necessity for its coming at all existed when the entire camp
was so near the army bakery of Washington. Once more
rumors became current that moving day was near, and
Saturday, the 11th, it was given out that seven days' rations
would be drawn on Monday, the 13th, preparatory to departure.
A target shoot marked this last Saturday in the
Poolesville camp. Sunday was a beautiful spring day,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">Apr. 11, '63</span>

though not as quiet as the day might be elsewhere, for the
bustle of preparation was evident on all sides. The ever
welcome band of the New Hampshire Regiment made the
time pass all the more rapidly with its vibrant melody.
There were just two days more in Camp Davis and then
came the change.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter">
    <h2>A RAINY MARCH</h2>
</div>


<p>The first orders were to the effect that the whole brigade
was to move, but these were so far modified that only the
Thirty-ninth was to go, though the New Hampshire Regiment
followed later. Washington was known to be the
destination, and provost duty was understood to be the
occupation. The start was made in the midst of a driving
rain, a fact, however, which did not prevent the Granite
State friends and those of the Battery thronging about to
wish their comrades a "God-speed." It was pretty generally
understood that the Thirty-ninth was selected as the first
to go because of the rasping relations, as to priority of
commissions,<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> existing between the respective colonels of
the two regiments.</p>

<p>The storm did not prevent the New Hampshire band
from turning out to give us a hearty send-off and there was
need of it, since the general sentiment, long before the halt
for the night came, was "the hardest yet." "Now came an
awful march through mud and water up to our knees;
many straggled behind, while others found it easier going
ahead of the Regiment." A stop for dinner was made in a
wood by the roadside, and by patience and care fires were
made for the preparation of coffee, and then we were off
again till at a distance of fourteen miles from Camp Davis,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>

about three miles from Rockville, a very moist camping
place was found in some pine woods, and such rest as saturated
garments would permit was sought beneath the protecting
cover of shelter-tents though many, utterly miserable
in their soaked condition, preferred to stand before
great fires which they had coaxed into burning. Others,
more thoughtful, but less careful as to orders, had taken
the opportunity to seek cover in barns and other places
of refuge along the way, some even getting good lodgings
in dwelling houses, all confident that they could easily
overtake the Regiment after a night's rest and drying.
Appreciation of Maryland villages or hamlets was at the
lowest ebb, one observer charactering Dawsonville as a
place of one house, a blacksmith shop and a few other
tumbledown buildings, while Darnstown was considered
appropriately named without further comment.</p>

<p>The morning of the 16th came none too soon, and many of
the boys who were getting great lessons in the "school of the
soldier," started off before the regimental orders to march
were given at 9 o'clock, the rain continuing to fall, though
not with all the emphasis and continuity of yesterday.
Those who had the money and started early enough obtained
excellent breakfasts in Rockville, the county seat of
Montgomery County, and by far the prettiest village these
blue clad wanderers had seen since passing through New
Jersey, an opinion coincided with by more than one regiment
in subsequent months. Here began a new experience
since, thence onward to the Capital, the road was macadamized
which, however much dryer it might be for the feet,
soon began to make them exceedingly sore, more trying
even than the muddy roads thus far encountered. While
thus advancing on Washington, the headquarter's wagon
was met on its way to Poolesville and, on the order of
Colonel Davis, the mail belonging to the Regiment was
taken out and distributed to the men, a most cheerful
episode in an otherwise very dreary day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="sidenote smcap">Apr. 16, '63</span>

Whatever the speed of the men who marched ahead of
the Regiment, they were all held up by the vigilant guards at
the first post of the pickets who were stationed around the
entire city. This was a few miles before reaching Tenallytown
and, at the post, the advance stragglers awaited the
coming of the main body. Showers had been intermittent
throughout the day and, after a march of sixteen miles,
the drenched sons of Massachusetts were pleased to reach
the above named place, practically a Maryland village,
though within the confines of the District of Columbia.
In or near the village was a large edifice, used as a retreat for
the priests and pupils of Georgetown College during the
summer season, and here the bedraggled Regiment found
refuge, reaching it through the great fortifications which
surrounded the city, portions of which had been seen on the
Virginia side of the Potomac, the nearest forts being Reno
and Gaines. That straggling was common became apparent
when an entire company found ample space in a single
room, whose comforts were all the more comfortable as
the men heard the rain which persisted through the most
of the night.</p>

<p>"Somewhere the sun is shining" never had a more hearty
greeting than when, after so many hours of pitiless pelting,
the morning of the 17th dawned clear and bright. Naturally
there were orders to dry and clean up, the house grates
affording opportunity for one, and our own industry accomplishing
the other. It was ten o'clock when the start was
made, but alas for human expectations! In vain were all
of our burnishings, for the mud, Georgetown-way, was simply
bottomless, and long ere the latter city was reached, the
Thirty-ninth looked even worse than it did when Tenallytown
was attained, though in their anxiety to retain the
morning's polish, in several cases dividing fences were
broken down that men might march between the street-fence
and the houses, thus getting out of some of the mud.
The ineffective rage of some of the protesting housewives
is still remembered. But an excess of mud and water could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
not efface the results of months of the hardest kind of
discipline and when "company front, by the right into line"
was heard, it was obeyed with a readiness and unanimity
that would have delighted the great Frederick and, baggage-burdened,
mud-bespattered and wearied with forty-eight
hours of most trying marching, the Regiment acquitted
itself most admirably through the streets and avenues of
Washington. At last the men realized the value of their
arduous labors on the drilling-grounds of Poolesville; they
believed in their Colonel and his associate officers, and when
they saw their lines as an arrow straight, every one, in
spite of all obstacles, keeping perfect step, best of all
they believed in themselves.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter">
    <h2>WASHINGTON.</h2>
</div>


<p>The halting place was Martindale Barracks, named thus
for General John H. Martindale who, a West Pointer from
New York (1835), had won distinguished honors in the
Peninsular campaign and, from the preceding November,
had been Military Governor of Washington. The barracks,
themselves, large and roomy, were located near the "circle,"
so called, where Washington and New Hampshire Avenues
intercept Twenty-third Street, all being to the Northwest of
the White House. The men had no difficulty in recognizing
the equestrian statue of Washington, by Clark Mills, which,
since February, 1860, had stood as the principal figure in
the Circle. The buildings to be occupied by the Thirty-ninth
were new, well ventilated and lighted, having all
reasonable conveniences, two stories in height, the first
for officer's quarters, cooking and dining rooms, while in
the second story were the best of accommodations for the
men. The quarters had been occupied hitherto by one
regiment only, the One Hundred and sixty-ninth New York,
which having reported in Washington, in October, '62,
had been doing provost duty until a few days before when

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">Apr., '63</span>

it was ordered to proceed southward to assist General
John J. Peck in the defense of Suffolk, Virginia. The
hospital, large and well equipped, won the admiration of
the men though, fortunately, there were few occupants
during the regiment's stay in the city.</p>

<p>Such were the new appointments to which the Thirty-ninth
was commended, something of a change from its
former rural surroundings, and a new course of duties was
about to be undertaken, though hardly had the brightening
up of uniforms and equipments begun ere orders came to
stay proceedings, for the regiment was to proceed at once
to Fortress Monroe, possibly to have a part in the Suffolk
campaign. Had this order not been countermanded and
the organization had followed after the One Hundred and
Sixty-ninth New York, and had participated in the latter's
services, while the Thirty-ninth would have had enough to
do, it would have entirely escaped the Wilderness, Spottsylvania,
Weldon Railroad and other experiences which make
up its thrilling war history. Once more settled in their
new quarters, confident that provost work in the Capital
is before them for an unknown period, the men proceed
to burnish up their weapons, to wash, brush and brighten
their uniforms and by the time for dress parade, at the
close of this first day in Washington, the closest observer
could not have detected any traces of the tribulations
through which the soldiers had so recently passed.</p>

<p>It is a life of rigid routine to which the regiment is now
committed; military conventionalities in the highest degree
are to be the rule for nearly three months; no more "Go as
you please" when on picket, nor the free and easy conditions
of the Poolesville camp for, seemingly, the eyes of
the public are on every man and he must be in the stiffest
form of polished brasses, dustless apparel and shiny shoes.
The discipline that was thought so severe before, now becomes
doubly so. Reveillé sounds at 5.30 a. m. and
thence onward till 8 o'clock, save for breakfast, the detailed
men are preparing for inspection, which takes place at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
office of the provost marshal, Captain Todd. When on
duty, the utmost punctiliousness is demanded and, if the
men of the Thirty-ninth do not approach perfection, it will
not be the fault of the regulations nor of the officers who
direct. To such an extent are the polishing and shining of
the rifles carried that some of the men are actually afraid
that they will wear the barrels out by such constant attrition.
When fully settled into the system of provost and
other forms of duty, much of the old time drill is suspended,
but there is something to do every day, as much as if the
men were laboring in a shop, at the desk or on a farm.</p>

<p>The chief exhibition occasions are those of dress parade
when distinguished people are not unlikely to appear. At
such times, President Lincoln is seen, and Senator Henry
Watson, that Massachusetts man of the people, is not an
unusual figure. Is Colonel Davis proud of his men? Rather,
how his face lights up at the immediate and perfect response
to his commands, and every movement of the long line of
soldiers is an effectual refutation of the stilted idea that
well informed men cannot make good soldiers. Indeed
the entire war was proof convincing that thinking bayonets
are the most reliable. Of the satisfying spectacle of
dress parade, an observer of the time comments, "So perfect
and strict were the drill and personal appearance that
in our line, of from eight hundred to nine hundred men,
not the slightest difference could be detected in any movement
from one flank to the other, as if performed by one
man, and, in that test of perfect drill, 'Order arms,' though
on a brick sidewalk, not one musket was behind the other,
all striking with one crash, which startled the spectators,
resembling a perfect volley of musketry."</p>

<p>It was a great change from picketing the banks of the
Potomac and doing guard duty about the Poolesville
region, to patrolling the thoroughfares of Washington and
guarding such points as the War Department, the White
House, the offices of the paymaster and quartermaster
general, General Heintzelman's Headquarters, the medical

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">Apr., '63</span>

purveyor, the post office, the headquarters for forage,
corrals for horses and mules, contraband camps, courts-martial
and other places of kindred character. The men
who had all of these duties to look after grew to consider
Washington a paradise for officers not on duty, but quite
the reverse for the enlisted man. The former could come
and go at his own sweet will while the latter, if he got a pass
at all, was subjected to so many conditions that more than
half of the pleasure was lost.</p>

<p>At the same time, in one way or another, the Regiment
grew to know Washington pretty well; the most of the
notable points were inspected and the young men from
far away homes took pleasure in seeing the evidences of
real home life on every hand; said one of them, "It seems
good to be in civilization once more." The 21st of April
brought the New Hampshire friends of Poolesville memory
and those beholding bade the Fourteenth a hearty welcome;
the regiment was assigned to quarters on New York Avenue,
its principal duty being the care of the Central guard house;
a fact that resulted most happily when Lieut. Carroll D.
Wright, subsequently colonel, was in charge, for certain
inconsiderate members of Scott's Nine Hundred, having
run in some of the Thirty-ninth's men, without sufficient
reason, that very efficient officer released the prisoners at
once, the incident being the only one in which our Massachusetts
men were even temporarily under arrest in Washington.
The two regiments partook of the neighborliness,
so long characteristic of the states whence they had come.</p>

<p>Many a soldier boy made mention of the fact that on
the 22nd Uncle Sam's paymaster happened around and left
four months' compensation, squaring accounts to the first
of March, and with "plenty of money in our pockets"
even provost guards could be gay and happy. An indication
of the steadiness of at least some of the men is found
when a diarist writes of the city division of the Sons of
Temperance and the cordial reception accorded him and
the lieutenant who accompanied him; later the same writer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
states that a large number of soldiers were present; not all
soldiers were or are dissolute. In these days the objects
of interest were pretty thoroughly inspected and many a
lad thought his blue coat quite in place in the President's
blue room; and few items near escaped them. They even
noted the cow that furnished the milk for the President's
family, and some admired the equestrian Jackson, nearly
opposite the White House; they threaded the mazes of
the Smithsonian Institute, lingering longest over Catlin's
wonderful collection of Indian faces, and one recites his
pleasure at meeting Frank Brownell, the slayer of Jackson,
the Mansion House murderer of Colonel Ellsworth of the
New York Fire Zouaves. On the 28th the shoulder-scales
that became a part of the display-uniform thereafter were
dealt out, a fact that secured for the Thirty-ninth the reputation
from certain ignorant fellows of being a regiment of
major generals. The month ended with a general observance
of the National Fast Day appointed by the President
in compliance with a request of the National Senate that
he set apart a day for national prayer and humiliation.</p>

<p>May found everybody intent on the struggle which Union
and Confederate soldiers were waging on the banks of the
Rappahannock. Hooker, who had been preparing since
the last of January, had begun the campaign which Union-loving
people were wishing would atone for the disaster of
December at Fredericksburg. Again the latter name became
familiar to the national ear, and these Massachusetts
men in Washington believed that their fellow native of the
Bay State would atone for some of the earlier misfortunes.
Incidentally much extra work came to the regiment in the
care of rebel prisoners, whom the Federals captured in the
later days of April and the earlier ones of May. Also, it
was the task of the Thirty-ninth to escort many of the
captives to more or less remote points for permanent retention.
Another duty was that of returning to the army
at the front large relays of deserters, many of whom had
returned under the general amnesty proclaimed for them,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">May, '63</span>

and in visiting Fredericksburg for this purpose, the escort
had a chance to see what real war meant. While following
the forces in the field up to and through Chancellorsville,
there was no lessening of local occupation and all
articles of wearing apparel had to be kept just as bright as
ever.</p>

<p>On the 10th much attention was attracted by the funeral
procession of General A. W. Whipple, one of the victims
of Chancellorsville, having been shot on the 4th, though
he survived till the 7th. A native of Greenwich, Massachusetts,
he was graduated at West Point, 1841, and his
fellow Massachusetts soldiers felt almost a personal interest
in the tokens of respect as the procession passed, including,
among many other distinguished public officers, President
Lincoln; the pall-bearers were eight first sergeants from
the Thirty-ninth Regiment. For many years, thereafter,
one of the great forts on the Virginia side of the Potomac
was to bear his name. Those of the Regiment, not on other
duty on the 11th and 12th, had the benefit of one of the
periodical scares liable to any locality near the seat of war.
Just before dress parade on the earlier date, at a quarter
of six, orders came to have the Regiment ready to march to
the Chain Bridge, the most northerly of the three great
connections between the District and Virginia. After
supper, with rubber blankets and overcoats properly slung,
the men were in line, prepared for the order to advance to
repel any possible rebel raid. The bridge is about five miles
from the barracks and the troops reached that point soon
after 10 p. m. No sign of any enemy appearing, they
stacked arms by the roadside and proceeded to get what
rest they could from the materials in their possession, every
one taking the trip as a mild kind of lark. At an early
hour of the 12th the return march was made by the men,
tired and dusty, though they were quite prepared for the
eight o'clock breakfast which the cooks had in readiness.</p>

<p>It was not all work in Washington; there were pranks
by the score, and now and then one was written down in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
the book of someone's recollection,&mdash;witness the following:
"a corporal of Company A with a guard was detailed
to look after certain condemned goods some two miles out;
with stripes and chevrons he was as slick and dapper a
youth as ever wore a uniform. Without a cent in his pocket,
and his entire party of twelve men equally lacking, he
took them all to the theatre to see Maggie Mitchell play
'Little Barefoot'; he had said to the men, 'Be ready at
seven o'clock, sharp, with shoes blacked and with brass scales
on shoulders, the U. S. on the belts, well polished.' They
obeyed and were marched off the grounds and along Pennsylvania
Ave., the Corporal saluting any patrol they
chanced to meet, right up to the theatre, itself; past the
ticket-office, and when tickets for the company were demanded,
the natty corporal threatened to arrest any one
venturing to halt or impede his men, so in they went to
the very best seats in the building, two dollar ones, and
there he seated his squad. Never was play better enjoyed
and when, at 9 o'clock or later, a lieutenant of cavalry
looked the house over in search of parties without proper
credentials, the corporal rose and, like a veritable Crichton,
saluted; how could any officer disturb such serenity
and immaculateness? He asked no questions; not a boy
in the party understood the circumstances under which
they were having the time of their lives, and the return
was quite as successful as the going; the whole affair, a
triumph of unqualified bluff and cheek."</p>

<p>Very likely many good veterans never knew that the
Northern soldiers in Washington maintained an active
Division of the Sons of Temperance, having their meetings
in Odd Fellows Hall, corner of Nineteenth Street and Pennsylvania
Avenue, and that, on public occasions, no branch
of the order turned out more men. Several officers and
men of the Thirty-ninth were deeply interested in the
society, and one of them records with some evident satisfaction
the fact that he had closed a rum hole and arrested
the keeper, making one less source of temptation. On the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">May 24, '63</span>

24th the boys from New England, with eyes alert for anything
savoring of home, discover the passing of the Eleventh
Massachusetts Battery, the Commonwealth's only Nine
Months' Artillery organization, on its way homeward.
Naturally the exchange of greetings was most hearty.
On meeting Major S. E. Chamberlain of the First Massachusetts
Cavalry, only recently severely wounded, yet out
and ready to return, an admirer writes, "If the service
were made up of officers like him, more would be done
towards putting down the Rebellion."</p>

<p>Pay-day came on the 28th, and the promptness of the
Government won no end of praise from the always impecunious
soldiers, a feeling that they were disposed at a
later time to considerably moderate.</p>

<p>The crowning event of the end of the month was the
joint drill of the Regiment along with the Fourteenth
New Hampshire some three miles away, in the rear of Mt.
Pleasant Hospital on Fourteenth Street. It was hot and
dusty, there having been no rain for three weeks, but the
men were put through their evolutions by Brig. General
Martindale, in a manner that evidently met his approval,
whatever those exercised may have thought of it. White
gloves and shiny scales suffered from the heat and dust
laden air, but the men bore ample testimony to the quality
of the drill on the old Poolesville grounds. However, the
principal honors came when the return was made, for though
the route step was allowed until the heart of the city was
reached, then came the display moment and, in column of
companies, the Regiment wheeled into Pennsylvania Avenue
with the precision of a machine, winning the applause of
the crowd of officers who were occupying the piazzas of
Willard's Hotel; and without music, but with the regular
tramp, tramp, that drill alone can impart, the men marched
to their quarters with an added notch in their appreciation
of what the Thirty-ninth could do.</p>

<p>In the way of dust and heat, June was to be a trying
month for the men who had to keep themselves in the very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
primmest form possible, since to be neat and speckless
was deemed the highest attainment of a soldier in town.
In those days there was voting by the citizens on local
matters and the drift of the ballots cast on the first day of
the month gave indications of a large secession spirit in
the city. On the second day, the Thirty-fourth Massachusetts
appeared in Washington for the performance of
duties, similar to those already falling to the lot of the
Thirty-ninth. Though from Worcester County and Berkshire
there was the common bond of statehood, and the
Thirty-fourth also prided itself no little on its discipline
and well drilled ranks. One of the members of the Thirty-ninth
comments on the hardness of appearance of some
of the prisoners whom he had to watch over and remarks
that, at the window by his beat is a girl, about eighteen
years old, who is a rebel spy, and that for five months she
was a corporal in the Union ranks. Of this same person,
Colonel Lincoln in his story of the Thirty-fourth relates
that, to curb her and keep her within bounds, one of his
officers was obliged to handcuff her.</p>

<p>So far as the amenities of Washington life for the regiment
were concerned, nothing contributed more than the
evenings spent in connection with the Sons of Temperance
organization, of which something might be said in addition
to former items. Formed in the Poolesville camp during
the preceding winter, it had been chartered by the Grand
Lodge of Massachusetts and was known as Army Lodge,
Number 39, and after reaching the Capital, its membership
increased to about two hundred. No better indication
of the moral quality of the regiment could be found.
Similar organizations among the residents of the city were
especially hospitable, and invitations to all sorts of entertainment
were of frequent occurrence. A festival on
the 12th, where not only the delicacies of the season were
served, but where literary and elocutionary ability were
displayed, was long memorable in regimental circles. Also
long remembered was Monday, the 15th, when large de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>tails

<span class="sidenote smcap">June 15, '63</span>

assisted in bearing to the several hospitals the grievously
wounded from Chancellorsville, many of whom had
been lying on the field for almost two weeks with scant
attention, some having suffered the amputation of limbs
at the hands of Confederate surgeons. Carried upon
stretchers as gently as possible, some of them fully two
miles, through the intense heat, some died on the way,
many more soon after arriving. While people along the
route did all that they could do to alleviate their suffering,
the condition of these unfortunate men was a startling
lesson to all of the awful possibilities of war.</p>

<p>It would be very strange if the guarding of the White
House grounds did not occasion some meetings with the
President. Of William S. Sumner, Company H, a second
cousin of Senator Charles Sumner, the following is related:
He had been stationed at a path, leading across a recently
seeded lawn, the path having formed a short cut to one
of the departments. Several officers had been turned back,
when Sumner saw the president approaching to take the
cut-off himself. He was promptly halted when the President
exclaimed, "What's up, Sentry?" To this, the sentinel
replied, "The grass is up, Mr. Lincoln." Looking down at
his feet, the president said, "Some of it would be down, if
I crossed over the lawn. I gave the order to place a sentinel
here and I am just ready to be an offender." He commended
the soldier for obeying his orders so strictly, even
to halting the President, and Sumner was also commended
by his own officers. Later when a comrade of his company
had obtained a sick furlough and could not secure transportation,
Sumner went with him to the White House, to
present the case to Mr. Lincoln, who, remembering the
incident of the hold-up at the lawn, readily wrote a line
to the quartermaster which speedily brought the desired
means of going home.</p>

<p>The campaign which was to reach its culmination at
Gettysburg was well under way. Lee was headed northward
and Union Governors were speeding troops towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
the South to assist in driving him back. Naturally, expectation
was at fever heat and every rumor simply added to
the excitement. Some of the men who visited Baltimore
to escort thither certain prisoners found the city with barricades
in the streets and negroes working on fortifications,
all under the apprehension of the coming of the rebel army.
Friday, the 26th, under the tidings that the enemy was
near Fort Massachusetts, north of Georgetown, the regiment
was ordered to be in readiness to move at a moment's
notice. Ammunition was given out and, in light marching
order, the men were excitedly expectant when the order
came to turn in and "snooze." As the sequel showed, had
the Thirty-ninth and other regiments marched out beyond
Tenallytown, a great wagon-train might have been saved,
but those in command had not the power of reading the
future.</p>

<p>How near the men came to meeting Stuart's Cavalry
appeared a little later. Rumors were afloat as to some
sort of disaster on the Maryland side of the Potomac and
not so very far away from the District. The result was
that late at night, orders were received to start at once for
the scene of depredation and after a rapid march of several
miles beyond the Chain Bridge, line of battle was formed
at about two o'clock in the morning of the 29th. If all
concerned could have known that the terrible Stuart and
his men were many miles away at the time, with no thought
whatever of molesting Washington or its defenders, very
likely the impromptu bivouac or "In place, rest" might
have been more comfortable than it really was. The event,
in which any act on the part of the regiment was altogether
lacking, was one more of those audacious deeds for which
the Confederate Kleber was famous. Crossing the Potomac
at Rowser's Ford somewhat south of Poolesville, under
the most difficult circumstances, early in the morning of
the 28th, he rode east to Rockville, whence a detachment,
a very small one, dashing towards the District, encountered
a wagon-train of one hundred and twenty-five vehicles,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">June 28, '63</span>

heavily loaded, on their way to supply the Union Army,
then marching towards the north. Though Stuart was
able to retain the train and to take it with him into Pennsylvania,
the delays occasioned by it rendered him and
his men much less efficient in the great encounter at
Gettysburg than they might have been otherwise.</p>

<p>The resignation of General Hooker from the command
of the Army of the Potomac had produced many an expression
of regret among the rank and file throughout the army,
but especially were regrets expressed among the men reared
in Massachusetts, the boyhood's home of "Fighting Joe."
With the steady progress of the rival armies northward,
it was apparent that a great battle was impending, and
that all available troops would be called into the fray,
though the demand did not come quite as early as expected.
While on the banks of the Mississippi, Vicksburg, and
around the quiet Pennsylvanian city, Gettysburg, were
acquiring new significance in the world's history, the capital
city, Washington, was preparing for the celebration of
the 4th of July, just as if that were the only matter of importance.
To begin with, all guards and patrols were
reduced one half in numbers, thus leaving a larger force
to participate in the parade. The military escort consisted
of the Second District of Columbia Volunteers, the Fourteenth
New Hampshire, the Thirty-fourth and Thirty-ninth
Massachusetts Regiments. The civic organizations
of the city looked and marched their best; the Marine
Band discoursed the kind of music for which it was famous.
Added interest might have been given to the day, had
news from the two great battles, just fought and won, arrived
in time. They would have given the celebration
the greatest cause for enthusiasm ever had by an Independence
Day, not accepting the first one of all. One prosaic
participant comments only this, "We marched from seven-thirty
to one o'clock; the sun terribly hot." So far as the military
features were concerned, the day ended at the Provost
marshal's office, where all were reviewed by Generals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
Heintzelman and Martindale. On reaching their quarters,
the soldiers were regaled with as good a dinner as their
cooks were able to provide. Another loyal Bay Stater
entered on his book these characteristic words, "It was
very well, but nothing when compared with Boston celebrations."</p>

<p>Sunday, the 5th, brought to the city general Daniel E.
Sickles, minus the leg which he lost on the second day of
Gettysburg, out by the peach orchard. A detachment of
the Thirty-ninth met the distinguished officer and escorted
him to his home. Official news of the surrender of Vicksburg
to General Grant was received on the 7th and loyal
Washington went wild with marching columns serenading
prominent officials and with the general illumination, the
Martindale Barracks not accepted. President Lincoln,
members of his Cabinet and Major General Halleck were
called on and each one responded with an appropriate
speech. On the 9th came the orders which, long expected,
were not unwelcome, for, though the Washington tour of
duty was free from long marches, the risk of battle and
the privations of camp, there was ever the thought that
the service was not strictly ideal for real soldiers, hence
the willingness with which dress coats and other form of
superfluous clothing were packed against their possible
need in the following winter. Contents for the knapsacks
were chosen with considerable more judgment than would
have been used nine months before.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter">
    <h2>JOINING THE POTOMAC ARMY</h2>
</div>


<p>It was about eight o'clock in the evening when the Regiment
formed line for the last time on the parade ground and
the men marched off for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad
station. The drums were beating and laughter and shouting
were quite in contrast with the solemn demeanor of
former passages through Washington, then intent on making
and retaining a reputation for discipline and self control.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="sidenote smcap">July 10, '63</span>

At the station there was a considerable wait for the Thirty-fourth
Massachusetts and two batteries which were to
accompany us. Hence it was late of the ninth or, rather
early in the morning of the 10th, before the start from
the city was made. Seven hundred and fifty strong, a large
shrinkage for the nine months of peaceful service, loaded
upon freight cars, the Regiment was headed for Harper's
Ferry. All sorts of items made the journey long and tedious;
says one of the boys, "The locomotive came near
running over a 'nigger'; the train broke in two; one of the
cars ran off the track," and another observer comments
on the heat and closeness of the night and cars. The ride
during the day was varied with characteristic incidents
of the halts where efforts were made to secure food from
nearby houses; at Frederick Junction where a branch road
runs up to the city, made famous by Barbara Frietchie
and Whittier, other troops joined the train and the same
sped on to its destination, not exactly the Ferry itself, but
Sandy Hook, the Maryland village opposite.</p>

<p>Darkness had settled down when the train reached the
point of unloading, and the debarkation was effected with
every one wishing he could see the wonderful panorama
that the place afforded, but before the scenery could be
enjoyed there was the biggest climb before the men that
they had ever undertaken. The road was only an apology
for one, though its mud was deep and adhesive; following
closely one's file leader was necessary, if a man would keep
in the procession. Finally there came a real climb up a
mountain's side with every man for himself, until there
was a blessed emergence on a plateau where, mud encrusted,
the men threw themselves upon the ground and slept the
sleep of exhaustion. The sun of the 11th, was well up
the sky, ere the wearied climbers awoke to admire the scene
developed around them. It did not matter much at what
time the waking came, since there were no rations and the
company cooks had no facilities for cooking even were
rations ready. It was not till a large detail had gone down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
to the railroad and brought hence the hardtack, coffee and
pork, that eating could be resumed, each one becoming his
own cook, though some of the soldiers declared that a
twenty-four hours' fast, along with unusual exertion had
made the repast the most appetising they had eaten in
months.</p>

<p>Those thus inclined had a chance to view a landscape
which had engaged the attention of Washington and
Jefferson, and which in more recent times had been the
observatory of John Brown, previous to the raid which,
without doubt, had helped precipitate the great conflict.
Down along the opposite banks of the Potomac were the
blackened ruins of the great armory, where had been made
so many guns, now in the hands of the enemy, and nearer
the middle of the village was the fire-engine house which
was to go down into history as the "John Brown Fort."
At Harper's Ferry, the Shenandoah joins the Potomac, and,
as a point of vantage, it had been held by both rebel and
Federal. A year before, the place had been given up by
Col. D. S. Miles to Stonewall Jackson, and is now in Confederate
possession, though the hurried construction of a
bridge across the Shenandoah indicates a disposition on
the part of the men in gray to depart. The retreat of Lee
from Gettysburg had involved the entire region in uncertainty,
hence the ordering out of regiments from Washington,
and the presence in the immediate locality of the
Eighth, Forty-sixth and Fifty-first Massachusetts, nine
months' regiments, which on their way home from North
Carolina were shunted off into this section, along with the
Thirty-ninth, forming a brigade under the command of
General Henry S. Briggs, first colonel of the Tenth Infantry,
also a Bay State organization.</p>

<p>While individuals might improve the opportunity to
admire the locality and to secure whatever the vicinity
afforded in the way of food, it was not a tour of observation
that took these men to this elevated section, and about
noon of Sunday, the 12th, came orders to move, but according

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">July 12, '63</span>

to traditional custom, the order was not carried
out until six o'clock. The march of the preceding night
had convinced many that they were too heavily laden,
and there being near the camp an elderly gentleman of a
most obliging nature, he consented to take charge of bundles
which the men made up, and, carefully marked, left
in his care, to be called for later. Of course many who relieved
themselves of burdens never called for their possessions
and the most of them thought the man himself would
become tired of his charge; but when years afterwards, a
Woburn veteran tried the experiment of writing for his
package, it came back to him forthwith, a remarkable
tribute to the honesty and system of the man. During
the ensuing night very many, who had not thus anticipated
the exactions of the march, lessened their burdens by throwing
away what had become intolerable.</p>

<p>The roads, trod by new regiments, were always marked by
just such evidence of the lessons of experience. The regiments
thus starting were the Eighth, Forty-sixth, Fifty-first
and Thirty-ninth Massachusetts, forming the Fourth
Provisional Brigade of the Second Division, First Army
Corps; the respective commanders being Generals John
Newton of the corps, John C. Robinson of the division, and
Henry S. Briggs of the brigade. The Thirty-fourth, which
had accompanied the Thirty-ninth from Baltimore, remained
and gave the parting good word as the Thirty-ninth
departed, the two organizations not to meet again
until the homeward march through Richmond in 1865.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter">
    <h2>AT THE FRONT</h2>
</div>


<p>When a brigade advances, all portions thereof do not,
cannot move at once, hence it was fully nine o'clock in the
evening of the 12th, before all were fully under way. It is a
forced march on which the soldiers are entering, and those
who are keeping the run of events will merge the 12th and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
13th together, there being no good stopping place between
them. As one writer expresses it, "up hill and down, so
dark that we can scarcely see, all night, right up to 5 o'clock
in the morning, when we halt for rest and breakfast in a
belt of woods, about two miles from Boonsboro."<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a> The
trials of that night were long matters of reference, blankets
were thrown away, so heavy did they become under the
severe strain to which all were subjected. When the halt
came, many threw themselves upon the ground for sleep,
rather than prepare their coffee, the prime source of strength
to the campaigner, and some of those who did set about
breakfast getting immediately fell asleep over the task,
so completely worn out were the marchers by the exactions
of the night.</p>

<p>Nor was the end yet, since all too soon for the tired soldiers
the sound of "assembly" calls them into the ranks and
"forward" is again the word. To crown their discomforts,
rain begins to fall and the mud to deepen, as the ranks once
more press forward through Boonsboro, and thence over
ways trodden by the participants in the Antietam battle
of the year before, the men obey orders and, being at the
right of the brigade, they pretty effectually distance their
friends in the other regiments and, finding themselves
practically alone, they are obliged to halt and await the
coming up of the remainder of the brigade; so thorough
had been the disciplinary drills on the Poolesville parade,
the men of the Thirty-ninth were equal to almost any
exaction. The termination of the long march was Funkstown,
an insignificant Maryland village, important only
as the point near which was stationed a part of the Army
of the Potomac, all awaiting the word to advance against

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
<span class="sidenote smcap">July 13, '63</span>

Lee, whose forces had been unable to recross the Potomac,
on account of the heavy rains, which had greatly swollen
the waters of that important stream.</p>

<p>Also the name had been heard a year before, when the
Battle of Antietam had for the first time given Funkstown
distinction, otherwise it might have slumbered a thousand
years with no signs of awakening. To the wearied men of
the Thirty-ninth who, in twenty hours or less, had traversed
through rain and mud from twenty-five to thirty
miles of wretched roads any sort of place was agreeable
for a terminal, and they were glad to hear the command
"Halt," and the subsequent direction to pitch tents was
equally grateful. Those that could turned in early, but
those unlucky ones who had to stand guard faced their
duty grimly, realizing that war was not altogether fun.
A skirmish line actively engaged, out towards the lines of
the enemy, gave to these inexperienced soldiers just the
least foretaste of what hostile bullets meant. There was
a general feeling that the morrow would bring the clash
of arms, and that the days of preparation were over. Ten
days after Gettysburg, the Confederates, at bay between
the river and the Federals, must either fight, drown or
surrender.</p>

<p>Lieut. Colonel Peirson who, when a member of the
Twentieth Massachusetts had served on the staff of General
Sedgwick, now commanding the Sixth Army Corps,
naturally improved the opportunity to call upon his former
leader. Our officer was received most kindly and the situation
was freely discussed, the General saying that he had
just returned from a conference of all the general officers,
at which it was decided that it was then inexpedient to
attack Lee, his force being about as large as our own and
his position for defense being stronger than ours for attack.
So depleted were the regiments by the great battle, so
recently fought, the Thirty-ninth was as large as almost
any brigade. Years later, on meeting General Meade in
Boston, the decision of the conference was confirmed, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
Potomac Army Commander telling Colonel Peirson that
the risk involved was considered too great. Of course of
this the rank and file, wondering when the orders to attack
would be heard, knew nothing.</p>

<p>The dawn of Tuesday, the 14th, revealed an entirely
different situation; the Confederates, afar from their case
of supplies, impoverished as to ammunition by the demands
of Gettysburg, hence in no condition to attack even if so
disposed, had worked industriously all of Monday, the
13th, in constructing a pontoon bridge across the Potomac,
at Falling Waters, over which they had withdrawn during
the night. To the rank and file, the situation did not
appeal as it did to those in command who saw in the escape
of the enemy the possible results of the fierce engagement
at Gettysburg vanish away. Men with guns, as
they advanced, were not encountering the expected opposition
and finally, when in the afternoon Williamsport was
reached and still no sight of the foe, the dullest man in line
realized that the fight for that day was off. One of the
observers inscribes in his diary these reflections, "If we had
attacked the rebels yesterday, we might have made great
havoc among them, crossing the river, but, as it is, we probably
will have to follow them into Virginia; pitched our
tents, cooked some coffee and went to sleep." Another
commentator remarks, "The Somerville (E) Company is
detailed as guard at General Newton's headquarters."</p>

<p>History is now repeat to itself, since Lee with his army
is moving up the Shenandoah Valley as he did after Antietam,
while Meade and the Union army will follow the
route of McClellan along the eastern side of the Blue
Ridge, appearing at each one of the successive gaps through
which the Confederates might essay a passage on their
return to their former stamping grounds. With what
might have had been, had Meade done this or that, we have
no more to do than with the events which followed Antietam,
and a like dilatoriness on the part of McClellan in
moving immediately on the enemy's works. Our present

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">July 14, '63</span>

concern is with and for the Thirty-ninth Regiment which
hears the reveillé at five o'clock in the morning of the 15th,
with the injunction to be ready to march in twenty minutes,
a command which resulted in a start at six o'clock. The
day is hot and sultry, the pace rapid and again men rid
themselves of everything possible to lighten their burdens
as they hasten over the dusty Maryland roads. Funkstown
is again sighted, though on the right, and the battle-line
of the day before is hurriedly passed. The gory field
of Antietam, where so many of the blue and the gray
mingled their life-blood, is also recognized and a halt is
called near Antietam Creek.</p>

<p>One of the early incidents of the day's march was the
meeting of the Sixth Corps and the First, rendering it
necessary for the two bodies to pass each other at nearly
right angles. The writer also notes the peculiar coincidence
that this passage of the Thirty-ninth was effected
through the ranks of the Thirty-seventh, a Western Massachusetts
regiment; just a chance to say "Good-morning
and Good-bye," all in the same breath. It was on this
day's march also that the news came of the fall of Port
Hudson and the bloody combats before Charleston, South
Carolina. Burnside's bridge, over the Antietam, is crossed
in the opposite direction from that taken by that leader a
year ago and the hurried way is pursued through Keedysville
to Rohersville where the camp is pitched for the night.
It has been a hard day, with a record of fully twenty-five
sun-broiling miles passed over, and to crown the miseries
of the march, rations are scarce, in most cases entirely
lacking. The story is told that a goose was appropriated
on the way, with the hope that soon opportunity might
be found for cooking it, but the wearied men, successively,
grew tired of carrying it and its body was left for some
luckier party, nearer the rear of the line, to enjoy on reaching
camp. The strain must be excessive which will cause
a soldier to throw away an edible luxury.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>As usual, the bugle summons the men from repose at
an early hour on the 17th and not a little rejoicing follows
the announcement that rations are to be drawn, so that
the day's exactions will begin on full stomachs. At not
quite so brisk a rate as that of yesterday, the route continues
through Crampton's Gap, on to a hillside near
Petersville, not far from Catoctin Creek, a name often
heard in stories of the locality. Berlin, a village somewhat
below Harper's Ferry on the Potomac, is the name of the
nearest river point, and all are pleased at the chance to
pitch their shelter tents, to rest, to clean up clothing and
weapons, and to realize that the soldier is not always on
the march. It was at this point that the chaplain and the
men who had been left in Washington rejoined the regiment.
The 17th of July introduces the variation of a heavy
rain, yet this does not prevent our active men from visiting
neighboring regiments whose depleted condition contrasts
vividly with the full ranks of the newly arrived.
Says one visitor, "Some of the old regiments do not number
more than our one company." On this day, obedient
to orders, the Fifty-first Regiment takes its departure
for the North and its muster-out, its entire tour of duty
from the first of the month having been over and above
the time called for by its term of enlistment.</p>

<p>The assembling of a great army is ever a magnificent
sight, and that presented by the several corps of the Potomac
Army, awaiting the laying of pontoon bridges across
the Potomac for the use of this great array of humanity,
forms no exception, a glorious sight even though seen
through showers of rain. It is the period also of wheat-harvest
and, notwithstanding the moisture, something
of an idea is obtained of how the staff-of-life looks in its
earlier stages. There is a deal of talk among the soldiers
as to how they ought to have fought and finished Lee, many
of them believing that the end of the Rebellion might
have been effected at or near Williamsport. By the 18th,
the bridges being in readiness, early orders are given that

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">July 17, '63</span>

all must be ready to advance at four o'clock, and for a wonder
the start is only half an hour behind the appointment.
The Fifth Corps and the cavalry crossed last night. The
Forty-sixth Massachusetts, one of the nine months'
regiments, accompanying us all the way round from Maryland
Heights, is but a few rods from the river, when orders
are received to fall out and proceed immediately to Baltimore
and so Northward; for some reason, the Eighth
Massachusetts, in the same category, still continues in
line. It was in these days that certain of the regiment,
thinking themselves so far from the region of military precision
they might essay a little abandon of style, attempted
to wear the "bell-hats," worn by some regiments, in place
of the visored, regulation caps required where style was
effected, but the Colonel would have none of it and to trade
back was the next thing necessary.</p>

<div class="chapter">
    <h2>IN VIRGINIA</h2>
</div>


<p>Quite nine months have passed since that hurried departure
from Arlington for the Maryland side of old Potomac's
shore and now, on the 18th of July, the sacred soil
is again trodden by Massachusetts feet as the regiment
takes its way through a section that fairly captivates the
eyes of these men so far from home and, after a march of
possibly thirteen miles, the lovely village of Waterford
is reached at about two o'clock in the afternoon. Considering
the unusual beauty of the village, its marked similarity
to just such assemblages of dwellings in the North, the
surprise of the visitors is not so great when they learn
that the place has furnished two full companies of soldiers
for the Union army. After a good night's rest, at 6 a. m. of
Sunday, the 19th, the regiment passed through the village,
keeping step to patriotic airs, while the people displayed
Union flags and cheered the passing men in blue; the scene<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
would hardly have been different, were they in one of their
own Northern towns. Through a continuation of yesterday's
scenic beauties, the march is made to the village of
Hamilton fifteen miles away, also a beautiful place, and
here the halt is made under trees so umbrageous that tents
are unnecessary, all declaring it the very best camping
place yet. The neighboring fields abound in seemingly
endless quantities of blackberries of which the hungry soldiers
proceed to eat their fill, not only satisfying hunger
but proving an excellent specific for certain ailments incident
to the season. Had the officers purposely directed
the army this way, they could have done nothing more
opportune for the health of the men. What Northern
home is ignorant of the healing qualities of blackberry
cordial? Better far than many responses to the surgeon's
call.</p>

<p>The men thought the Sunday well spent and, after a
twilight devoted to reminiscenes, wherein of course home
abounded, couches on mother earth were sought, hoping
that sleep might be undisturbed until morn. It was well
that rest was taken early for it is only two o'clock of the 20th
when morning sleep is broken by the bugle call; evidently
a long march is in prospect, but from characteristic delays,
it is fully five o'clock before faces are again set southward,
the route being through a section badly scarred by the
ravages of war. About twenty miles are passed over in
reaching Middleburg, a place on the Alexandria and
Winchester turnpike, of some local importance, whose
inhabitants are largely if not entirely secesh, and we are
told that many of them, being in Pickett's Division, had
suffered greatly at Gettysburg. Indeed one lady, the
mistress of a large and elegantly furnished mansion, apparently
one of the F. F. V.'s, who very kindly responded to
the requests of the Union soldiers, when thanked most
respectfully for her consideration, replied that she only
wished people on the other side might have done as much
for her son who was killed at Gettysburg. On the way

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">July 20, '63</span>

hither, the regiment has the new experience of fording a
stream, Goose Creek, from two to four feet deep and from
80 to 100 feet wide.</p>

<p>A heavy picket line is thrown out because of the proximity
of guerrillas, who prowl around like jackals intent
on mischief; and they already had captured several division
staff officers who had ridden too far ahead, for the
purpose of selecting proper camping grounds. The tour
of picket duty was not without its compensation since an
abundance of blackberries was revealed by the morning
of the 21st which, with food foraged from the enemy's
country, helped out the somewhat reduced rations of the
haversack. In the preceding night Samuel W. Joyce,
Company C, a Medford boy, had died, worn out by the
exactions of the expedition, and a prayer by the chaplain
is the sole service as his body is committed to the earth,
since in active warfare scant time is found for burial ceremonies.
The entire day is passed in this camp, thus affording
a needed rest while time is found for observation, not
alone of the neighboring fields, abounding in berries, but of
the people among whom no men of military age are found
and of the fact that Confederate money finds greater favor
here than the currency of Uncle Sam, a peculiarity however
that gradually disappears as the months advance.</p>

<p>It is two o'clock, p. m. when the command to pack up
is heard, but it is nearly or quite sundown before the start
is made, since the brigade is taking its turn on the left of
the line; also the guarding of the wagon train is committed
to the brigade and in this somewhat arduous duty the
Thirty-ninth bears its part. Over roads, never conspicuous
for smoothness, now worse than ever, the troops and the
train pick their weary way till 3 a. m. of the 23rd, when
White Plains is reached, a distance of not more than eight
miles from Middleburg, but a wearying march nevertheless.
It is pretty generally understood that both the rebel
and the Union armies are racing for the Rappahannock,
and the Federals have the inside track. The wagons are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
parked here, for mules must, if men do not, rest, and those
guarding have the privilege of a bivouac for a short period,
while the other troops have been resting a large part of
the night. Repose is enjoyed for about four hours when,
at seven o'clock in the morning, we are routed out and, two
hours later proceed on our route to Warrenton, some
thirteen miles away, getting there not far from five in the
afternoon. Much to the astonishment of the wearied
marchers, a dress parade is ordered, and the men go through
the form, though they would much prefer to rest their
tired bodies prone upon the ground.</p>

<p>Warrenton is one of the names which every one has
heard, over and over, ever since the beginning of the war,
and all conclude that it must have been a very interesting
as well as beautiful place before hostilities had marred
its loveliness; the county seat of Fauquier County it
possesses all of the public buildings belonging to such a
place and betrays evidence of thrift, enterprise and culture.
Secesh to the core, the people prefer Southern currency,
though they will also take that of the North. In camp
on a hill to the rear of Warrenton, the 24th is spent, rations
are drawn, letters written to the homeland, and a big notch
made in the stick of soldierly experience. With true military
routine a dress parade is had at seven o'clock, just for
the sake of maintaining the regimental altogethery feeling.
Early in the morning of the 25th march is resumed and
continues through a dry, level country, destitute alike
of shade and water, the sun all of the time giving indications
of his heat rays; occasional halts do not negative the
fact that it is a long and tiresome march, on account of
which many a man would have been overcome by the
heat had not all been thoroughly acclimated in the vigorous
drills of the preceding months. Thirteen miles of desolation
bring us to noon and Warrenton Junction and, best of
all, to the sight of water. The stream, though small and
already muddied by all sorts of animals in their efforts for
drink, is none the less sought with ardor by the thirsty men,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">July 25, '63</span>

who pronounce this the dryest day in all their army experience.</p>

<p>Here is found a depot of supplies, the communication by
rail and steam with Washington being direct and regular so
that commissary and quartermaster stores are replenished;
near by is the whole Army of the Potomac, though there is
every indication of going further on every hand and, while
seemingly in direst confusion, no one appeared to get in
another's way, convincing proof that some guiding power
had all these different lines well in hand. What a chance to
visit this and that friend in other regiments, an opportunity
of which hundreds of men availed themselves, and
many a meeting here was the last in this life. Making camp
in a nearby grove, rest is sought, save as it is interrupted
by rations-drawing, until there comes the order to fall-in
once more, but by this time the men have learned that a
certain amount of leeway is to be allowed in these marching
orders, and they do not respond with all of their former
alacrity. It is from this point that Major Tremlett, accompanied
by men from several companies, goes North
for the purpose of looking after recruits expected from
conscripts and substitutes. The second installment of this
day's march really began about 7 p. m. and continued
possibly seven miles to Bealton Station, on the Orange
and Alexandria Railroad. Lack of water had made the
morning's route hard to bear; nothing of the sort troubled
that of the evening, since a pelting rain beat upon the faces
of the marchers, filled the roads with mud and made the
rivulets swelling torrents. With a single exception this was
the severest storm ever encountered by the Thirty-ninth,
that exception being the one when crossing the Occoquan
on the return of Washington after the surrender. It is
one o'clock in the morning of the 26th, that the regiment,
though completely saturated with rain, files into an open
field, and finds such repose as it can until the light of day.</p>

<div class="chapter">
    <h2>FIRST ARMY CORPS.</h2>
</div>


<p>It was here and on this day that the Eighth M. V. M.,
having accompanied the Thirty-ninth in all of its wanderings
from Maryland Heights, took its leave of the Potomac
army and, obedient to orders, embarked at Warrenton
Junction for Washington, its nine months' tour of
duty being long overpast, and a happy lot of soldiers they
were, with the prospect of a speedy return to their homes.
Of course there were the regular details for pickets, but
the most of the regiment had a chance to clean up and
to rest after the exactions of the preceding night. The
departure of the Eighth caused the end of the Provisional
Brigade, under the command of General Briggs, the latter
returning to Washington, while the Thirty-ninth became
a part of the First Brigade, Second Division, First Army
Corps, the division and corps being the same as before; the
other members of the brigade were the Thirteenth Massachusetts,
Sixteenth Maine, Ninety-fourth and One Hundred
and Fourth New York, and the One Hundred and Seventh
Pennsylvania, the Commander being Colonel Peter Lyle
of the Ninetieth Pennsylvania regiment. The dress parade
at the close of this day was signalized by a sequel to the
bell crowned hats, already referred to, since a number of
the men in Woburn Company (K), wearing the obnoxious
headgear and otherwise grotesquely arrayed, appeared
on the parade ground, exciting the risibles of all beholders
and securing for themselves a command to report at the
colonel's headquarters, where even his equanimity was
upset and, after a hearty laugh, he let the culprits off with
a reprimand and some extra policing about his tent.</p>

<p>The sweet sleep to which the regiment commended itself
at "Taps" was interrupted at 11 p. m. by the command
to "pack-up" and "fall-in" and soon afterward the
Thirty-ninth was marching southward, making the best
of the way alongside the railroad, not always careful to
keep the middle of the road, this being one of the lapses of

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">July 26, '63</span>

Colonel Davis, viz., that he was willing that the men should
keep their feet dry if possible. He had even excited the
ire of General Briggs by insisting that, when only keeping
in line was the point at issue, his men should march dry-shod,
thus possibly accounting for the extra marching
ability of his men. Rappahannock Station, where the
Orange and Alexandria Railroad crosses the river, was
the point aimed at, and very early in the morning of the
27th it was reached, and the broken slumbers of the preceding
night were resumed for a brief period. The remainder
of the First Brigade was here along with several thousand
cavalrymen. The remaining days of July were spent
in the camp established near the banks of the Rappahannock,
on an elevation overlooking the river. There was
nothing to disturb the general quiet of the place, though
Union soldiers picketed one side of the stream, a narrow
one here, and rebels the other. The railroad bridge had
been destroyed and the coming of a train load of pontoons,
in the evening of Wednesday, the 29th, called for a large
detail of men from each company to unload them, a rather
heavy task, while showers, many of them very severe,
made even tent life anything but comfortable. Somewhere,
in these meanderings, a character of Company G won fame
for himself in the aptness of his reply to Captain Trull. As
he fell in for dress parade, the Captain noticed that the
private's shoes were plastered with Virginia mud, and
sent him to his quarters to make them more presentable.
Presently he returned with the fronts of said shoes much improved,
but the after portions were as before. When
asked by the irate Captain why he had not blacked the
heels as well as the front of his shoes, the witty fellow
replied that a good soldier never looked behind.</p>

<p>Lest the men through idleness might grow rusty, the
last day of July was marked by a drill, and later the orders
were given that at two o'clock in the next morning, August
1st, the camp should be broken and all be ready to march
soon after. While the day did not bring on an engage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>ment
there was much of interest in seeing the cavalry cross
the river and in beholding the disappearance of the Confederate
pickets and in hearing the sounds of more or less
firing beyond the hills across the stream, in the direction
of Culpeper Court House. Our crossing was effected about
two o'clock in the afternoon, line of battle was formed and
under a blazing sun we advanced until a piece of woods
was reached where every man improved the least chance
possible for escape from the intense heat. After a considerable
halt and consequent rest, the line fell back fully
a mile, halting on the brow of a hill where trees and underbrush
were cut away to favor firing of both artillery and
musketry, while the fallen timber would serve as an abatis.
Until the 8th of August the Regiment remained here, digging
intrenchments, doing picket duty, witnessing the almost
constant activities of the Cavalry, which kept the enemy
stirred up, and on the 3rd it seemed as though the Confederates
were really coming our way, but it proved to be
only a reconnoisance in force, and the Union forces were
found on the watch. Colonel Lyle having leave of absence,
Colonel Davis succeeded to the command of the brigade
and Lieut. Colonel Peirson to that of the regiment. For
diversion, the men had berry picking and foraging generally
in front of, and bathing in the Rappahannock behind
their lines, and on Wednesday, the 5th, all were surprised
and delighted by the appearance of Major Bell,
paymaster, who left many tokens of Uncle Sam's honesty in
the hands of the men, a large portion of which was speedily
sent northward for the benefit of kindred there. Thursday,
the 6th, was a day of national thanksgiving for the
victories that had attended the Union arms and at brigade
headquarters there were religious services by the chaplains
of the Sixteenth Maine, the Ninety-fourth and
One Hundred and Fourth New York, and by General Briggs,
temporarily in command of the division. The proclamation
of the President, calling for this observance, was issued
July 15th, the kind heartedness and devotion of Mr. Lincoln

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">Aug. 6, '63.</span>

appearing in every sentence. While the entire document
might be read with profit to-day, let the following
extract suffice:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>But these victories have been accorded not without sacrifices
of life, limb, health and liberty, incurred by brave, loyal and
patriotic citizens. Domestic affliction in every part of the
country follows in the train of these fearful bereavements. It is
meet and right to recognize and confess the presence of the
Almighty Father and the power of His hand equally in these
triumphs and in these sorrows.</p></div>

<p>That the men might participate in the spirit of the day
there was a suspension of drills, though a morning inspection
reminded everyone that routine constitutes a large
part of a soldier's life.</p>

<p>Dress parade on the 7th was omitted on account of one
of the severe storms with which the season was rife, accompanied
by thunder and lightning and wind to the extent
of blowing down the brush protection which many of the
men had set up around their tents; many of the tents
went down also&mdash;as one of the unfortunates records it, "most
of the boys got drowned out." Saturday, the 8th, brought
a change, in that orders were received about 11 a. m. to
prepare dinner early in order to be ready to march, though
we did really remain till after five o'clock before starting,
carrying with us tent-poles and everything movable that
might contribute to the comfort of the new stopping place,
which proved to be across the river and very near where
we were before the advance beyond the Rappahannock.
Apparently, the entire brigade came back with us. Though
no one was conscious of the fact at the time, here the
Thirty-ninth was fated to remain with the other parts of
the Potomac Army for more than a month. Though we
had marched with the army all the way down from Funkstown,
we had not fought at Gettysburg, nor had we participated
in that trying race with Lee's forces all the way
from Falmouth to the foregoing sanguinary field. Regiments
had become little better than skeleton organiza<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>tions;
mounts for cavalry and artillery were sadly wanting
and a period for recuperation and replenishing was
absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>"Reveillé at 4.30 a. m.; splendid morning and the distant
bugles and drums over hill and vale proclaim that
the army is awake," such was the entry in his diary of one
of the Thirty-ninth whose day was given to guard duty,
in an open field exposed to the fierce rays of an almost
tropical sun, while many of his comrades devote much
of their daylight to procuring and placing boughs around
and over their tents to render less oppressive the August
heat. One wonders whether it was piety or dislike of work
which prompted the following item in another diary, "Other
regiments have religious services; ours never does; had
to keep at work all day"; that dress parade closed the day
might be concluded without the saying. Owing to the
nearness of other regiments, it is easy to compare their
scanty numbers with the full ranks of the Thirty-ninth,
while the Twelfth and Thirteenth turn out with scarcely
a corporal's guard in numbers for several of the companies,
the Thirty-ninth has five hundred men, this very day, on
parade, though a shrinkage of one half is quite an item,
especially when there has been no loss on the battlefield.
The utility of constant drill, especially in these superheated
days is not appreciated by the older regiments in the brigade,
and means are usually found to sidetrack the orders
of Colonel Davis, acting commander of the brigade, but
the Thirty-ninth obeys them to the letter.</p>

<p>The round of guard and picket duty keeps everyone in
active condition, particularly as there are drill and fatigue
for any not otherwise employed. The picket line is across
the Rappahannock, about two miles and a half towards
Culpeper, not far from the early August camping ground.
That there is every indication of a prolonged stay here is
emphasized by the appearance of the sutler, on the 12th,
who proceeds to establish his plant and to open out some
luxuries, always appetizing to the average soldier, though

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">Aug. 12, '63</span>

forty-six cents a pound for cheese and one dollar a bottle
for syrup and preserves make a man think twice before
buying. The Medford men, Company C, are somewhat exultant
over the fact that Captain Hutchins, on the 13th,
is in command of the Regiment, since Lieut. Colonel Peirson
is in command of the picket line and Major Tremlett
is in Boston. During these days many drafted men arrive
and are added to certain of the older regiments, though
the permanent good derived from their coming is hardly
commensurate with the trouble and expense incident to
their presence. America never had much use for involuntary
soldiering.</p>

<p>The 15th, Saturday, brought orders to be ready to march
at a moment's notice but, as often happened, nothing came
of it. The following day there was a movement of certain
troops by train to Alexandria, for what purpose no one
knew, though doubtless a part of the scheme to strengthen
the Carolinas and the West which, eventually, will
take a considerable number of men from Meade's Army.
Everyone is learning the extremes of midday heat and
midnight cold and many sigh for the material thrown away
on the marches southward from Antietam. Those in
authority are becoming alive to the fact that sleeping on
the ground is conducive to summer ailments, and the
consequent order goes forth that bunks shall be constructed
and the tents correspondingly elevated. No one is permitted
to get homesick on account of having nothing to do.
Owing to the absence of Surgeon Page, the surgeon of the
One Hundred and Seventh Pennsylvania has temporary
charge of the sick in this regiment, and his diligence makes
an exceedingly favorable impression. During this quiet
period along the Rappahannock, the railroad bridge across
the river is repaired or rebuilt, the pontoons are taken up
and sent away and the men are realizing what regular mails
and rations mean. The latter are so full and free that an
excess of coffee especially forms an excellent medium of
exchange with the rebel pickets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 19th, more troops returned from the south side of
the river, leaving scarcely more there than the Second
Brigade of the Second Division; evidently some change
of lines is in prospect. One man records his opinion that
the construction of an oven for the baking of beans is a
sure indication of a general move of the army, activity
generally following any attempt at permanency. It is in
these August days that the several companies are recalling
the first anniversary of their muster-in and comparing
notes between now and then. Though the Regiment has
not been called to face the enemy on the field of battle,
the time has by no means been wasted, since the drill and
discipline that Colonel Davis and other officers have insisted
on have made the organization ready for almost
any test that may come in its way. The 28th of the month
was marked by the return of Colonel Davis to the Regiment;
Colonel Lyle having resumed his position at the
head of the Brigade. As a consequence, all forms of drill
received an immediate impetus. It was about this time
(28th) that the Pennsylvania Reserves presented General
Meade with a magnificent sword, the presentation taking
place some three-fourths of a mile away, and Governor
Curtin of the Keystone State, General Heintzelman and
other distinguished men being present. Rumor says that
the blade was originally intended for General John F.
Reynolds, Commander of the First Corps, killed at Gettysburg.</p>

<p>It was in the last week of August that the knapsacks,
left by orders at Funkstown, were received by their owners,
but their contents, valuable or otherwise, had already
been appropriated by others; much disappointment resulted,
since many a soldier had reckoned on the material,
supposed to be there, for relief in the cold nights along
the Rappahannock. As Government allowance for clothing
was only $42 a year and the securing of sufficient
apparel seemed necessary, not a few boys in the Thirty-ninth
found themselves in debt to Uncle Sam instead of being

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">Aug. 29, '63</span>

prospective recipients of two months' pay, one of the
hardships that the men were obliged to undergo through
no fault of their own. Over in the Fifth Army Corps, on
the 29th, was enacted a play in real life, if such a scene
could be called a play&mdash;the execution of deserters. The
coming and going of recruits had become so common that
examples must be made of some of the flagrant cases.
Drafted men, unwilling to enter the service, had the privilege
of purchasing exemption by the payment of a large
sum of money, the men accepting the same and taking
the place of the drafted men received the general name
of substitutes. In quite too many cases these men, finding
the occupation lucrative, deserted again and again, each
time re-enlisting, gaining many dollars thereby, while
the army received no increase. These five men, shot to
death while sitting upon their coffins, afforded a salutary
lesson for others, similarly inclined, to see and heed. General
F. A. Walker, in his history of the Second Army Corps,
says, "The shooting of a score of bad men in 1861 would
literally have saved the lives of thousands of good men in
1862 and 1863." The best soldiers were those who, realizing
the peril of their country, took their lives in their own
hands and, as it were, offered them a willing sacrifice for
the Nation's salvation; if they escaped death, that was
their good fortune, their supreme devotion was nothing
lessened thereby. The month ended with an inspection
by Lieut. Colonel Peirson and muster for two months'
pay.</p>

<p>In the concluding days of August, pains had been taken
in rearranging the camp, resulting in well defined company
streets, and thereafter much time was spent in securing
boughs and placing them so as to lessen the burning
heat of midday; it is an excellent trait of healthy, well
meaning men that, following a brief rest, they always are
disposed to enhance the possibilities of comfort. With the
3rd of September (Thursday) came a rigid inspection of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
equipments and clothing, conducted by General Robinson,<a name="FNanchor_F_6" id="FNanchor_F_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a>
Division Commander, the event having a suspicion of
greater military activity. The entire brigade with its six
regiments numbers about two thousand men, of whom
the Thirty-ninth constitutes more than one-fourth, our
Regiment being the only one not yet exposed to the losses
of battle. Another indication of aggression or apprehension
is the building of defenses and the advance of the
Union picket line; a like approach of the enemy brings
the Blue and the Gray pretty near each other. Friday
night, the 4th, was noteworthy in that boxes, which should
have reached the Regiment in Washington, were announced.
Of course the food, prepared by loving hands in the distant
North, was long past the condition of use, but articles of
apparel came in a most convenient season; had they come
before leaving Washington or on the trip southward, they
doubtless would have been thrown away or, at any rate,
left behind in some of the cachés established on the march.</p>

<div class="chapter">
    <h2>FIRST ANNIVERSARY.</h2>
</div>


<p>Sunday, the 6th of September, set many a mind to thinking,
for it was the first anniversary of the departure from
Boxford, and a year before hardly an enlisted man thought
the war would last so long, yet he beheld himself a mere
atom in the immensity of the strife, at the moment taking
breath before the next effort. One of the scribes writes in
his book of innermost thoughts, "I see very few signs of

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
<span class="sidenote smcap">Sept. 12, '63</span>

the end as yet." Another laments the barbarity of men
and boys who, gently born and reared, will destroy needlessly
the property that comes in their way, instancing a
beautiful house, across the river, out towards Culpeper,
whose F.F.V. owner had followed the Confederates in their
falling back, and not only had the furniture, elaborate
and choice, been utterly broken to pieces, but the covering
of the mansion had been torn off also, so that the bare
framework of the structure remained, only one of hundreds
of examples that might be narrated. On this day a cavalry
force, under the lead of Generals Buford, Kilpatrick and
Gregg advanced across the Rappahannock and, engaging
the mounted force of General J. E. B. Stuart, drove it
steadily back to and through Culpeper, capturing one
hundred prisoners and some of the English light guns of
the enemy. Dashing along to the Rapidan, Buford and
his men, encamped on the banks of that already noted
stream and then made their way back, not without difficulty,
to the Union side of the Rappahannock.</p>

<p>With the beginning of the second year's service since
the start from Boxford, enters a new division of time in
the camp:&mdash;Reveillé at sunrise, police-duty, fifteen minutes
later; sick-call at 6 a. m.; breakfast, 7; drill, 7.30; recall,
9.30; dinner, 12.30; drill, 3 to 5; dress parade, sunset;
tattoo, 8.30; taps, 9 p. m. A long-needed rain came in violent
form on the 12th, doing much good, yet was not exactly
comfortable for those who had their tents blown down;
however, well filled springs were quite consoling in that
the regular water supply had grown conspicuously low.
The 12th, too, is the day which marked the departure of
Longstreet from Lee's army to the relief of Bragg in Georgia
and Tennessee, not to return till the battle of the Wilderness
is in progress. It takes very little time for the news
to reach the hither side of the Rappahannock and an immediate
movement towards the south follows, the Second
Corps and the Cavalry being the first to advance on the
13th, with the purpose of so engaging the attention of Lee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
that he will send no more troops to assist in the possible
discomfiture of Rosecrans.</p>

<p>The 14th marked the coming of Paymaster Major Burt,
and the squaring of accounts for the preceding two months,
though the clothing items reduced the compensation in
certain cases almost to the vanishing point. Constant
activity across the river, the passing of many heavily
loaded trains and their return with loads of prisoners and
wounded Union soldiers indicated the rapid pushing of
things in that direction, and the inevitable advance of the
remaining portions of the Federal force. Early in the
morning of the 16th came the expected order to be ready
to march at 5 a. m. Everything was in readiness, but
the start was not made until 7 o'clock and then the regiment
and the entire First Corps again crossed the Rappahannock
by means of pontoon bridges and advanced towards
Culpeper. A considerable part of the way was over
an excellent road, though the rations, extra supplies of
cartridges and the recently filled knapsacks made the way
a hard one. Recent experience of cold nights had taught
the men the necessity of retaining their extra apparel but,
if some of the unnecessary ammunition were thrown away,
it was because the men soon learned that large quantities
of cartridges were entirely too burdensome. Though the
distance marched was only twelve miles it seemed very
much longer, leading by Brandy Station, a name in a few
months to become almost a household word both North
and South, and in general along the line of the Orange and
Alexandria Railroad. While the Second and Sixth Corps
had advanced to the Rapidan, the First Corps was held
in reserve, some three miles east of Culpeper.</p>

<p>For a little more than a week this was to be the camping
place of the Thirty-ninth and with accustomed diligence
there speedily followed the regular round of inspections,
drills and parades, though there were many and
large details for picket duty. An inspection on the 17th
seemed largely for the purpose of ascertaining how gener<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>ally

<span class="sidenote smcap">Sept. 14, '63</span>

or otherwise the men had retained the extra ammunition
dealt out to them; how successfully delinquents were
helped out by those who had retained their heavy loads
was long a theme for lengthy dissertations in company circles.
The location of the camp upon a rising knoll made
it the sport of the winds and the distance of both wood
and water was a special hardship. Even then, when water
was obtained, it was found to be so hard or so impregnated
with lime as to be very distasteful to New England men
who had been brought up where soft water was quite the
vogue. An indication of a more or less prolonged stay
appeared on this, the 17th, when the regimental sutlers
put in an appearance and setting up their tents were ready
for business. They were not likely to follow too closely an
army in motion. Also drills and inspections marked the
resumption of regular soldier regimen. The weather was
singularly cold for the season of the year; in strolling about
the vicinity, it was easy to discover where the enemy had
lately encamped.</p>

<p>The advent of eight days' rations on the 22d with an
injunction to pack five days' portion in our knapsacks
made us think that some unusual stunt was impending.
A Division-drill signalized the 23rd, General Robinson
conducting the same. The 24th brought the expected
change, the regiment marching a few miles down the Rapidan
near Raccoon Ford, occupying some portions of the
camp held until this morning by the 12th Army Corps,
the latter along with the Eleventh having been ordered
to arrange for a transfer to the Army of the Cumberland
in the Tennessee country; this move being made lest
Longstreet's presence with his force should give too hard
a problem for Rosecrans to solve. While the orders to
Howard and Slocum, of the Eleventh and Twelfth respectively,
were issued on the 24th, it was not till the 3rd of
October that the great organizations reached their destination.
Of far greater consequence to some of the men in
the Thirty-ninth was the fact that home-boxes just arrived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
from Washington had to be left behind. The 25th sees
the renewal of regular camp activities along with the necessary
cleaning up after the departure of the Twelfth
Corps. The 26th saw a large force of twenty-five men
from each company, under the command of Lieut. Colonel
Peirson, proceeding to the banks of the Rapidan for picket
duty. It was while nearing this point that the residence
of Dr. John H. Stringfellow of Kansas notoriety, then or
later a Confederate Surgeon, was reached and the man
himself was interviewed, who declared his undeviating
secession proclivities. Though certain of these Massachusetts
men would have liked to repay some of the debts
due him, they concluded that he was getting his punishment
as he went along, for evidently his situation in the
midst of contending armies was rapidly reducing him to
a condition of absolute destitution.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter">
    <h2>THE RAPIDAN.</h2>
</div>


<p>Picketing along the Rapidan at this time was not a hardship,
since by mutual consent there was no firing, and the
native Yankee disposition to explore had full vent, when
not actually on post, the reserve furnishing many opportunities
for learning habits and conditions of the people
not otherwise attainable. Relieving the Ninetieth Pennsylvania,
one-half of the detail attended to extreme outpost
duty, while the other part enjoyed absence of drill
and inspections around the reserve camp, "Revelling in
that delicious abandon, one bright spot in a soldier's life,
when he can do just what he pleases." Thus it was an
even turn-about during the days on the river, in these
parts only a narrow stream of possibly three rods' width.
Most cordial relations existed between Reb. and Fed. and
the trades between the Blue and the Gray proved that no
monopoly in the swapping habit was enjoyed by the
Yankee. Whatever extra coffee the boys possessed proved
to be as good as cash, if not better, when dealing with these

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">Sept. 27, '63</span>

lads from the Southland. They even swam across the river
to partake of Northern hospitality and to facilitate
exchanges. The nights being cold, campfires were kindled
on both sides and the alleged enemies kept as comfortable
as possible, in plain sight of each other.</p>

<p>In the stillness of the Sunday evening (27th) the Confederates
in their camp indulged in a prayer-meeting and
their hymns, the same that Northern Christians were
singing at that very moment in the far away churches,
were plainly heard by the hostile soldiery on our side of
the stream. Need there be any wonder that some listeners
moralized on the absurdity of men who read the same
Bible and sang the same songs, spending several years
of their lives, none too long at the longest in shooting at
each other? Here took place the famous exchange of song,
so often told in campfires and wherever it is desirable to
prove that one touch of Nature makes the whole world
kin. One night the Rebs. started off on the "Bonnie Blue
Flag," and when their strains had ceased, the Yanks got
back at them with the "Star Spangled Banner"; next
the Boys in Gray tuned up with "Maryland, My Maryland"
and those in Blue naturally retorted with "The Red
White and Blue"; breaking the lull that ensued, our men
started John Howard Payne's immortal and universal
"Home Sweet Home"; scarcely had the first note been
struck before the sympathetic enemy chimed in, and
Virginian woods and hillsides echoed with the tender strains
clearly showing how Saxon blood remembers. On another
occasion a musical exchange, beginning with "Pennyroyal,"
ran through the list of then popular melodies, though all
sang in unison, and very naturally, too, for ending "Old
Hundred." Will not coming generations wonder that
men who could together sing the old songs should ever
fight each other?</p>

<p>Monday, the 28th, ended the stay by the river's side and
the detail returned to camp, coming up with it some two
miles nearer than when it was left, a fact that in no way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
disturbed those coming back. While a large part of the
Regiment was on its tour of duty, those left behind were
by no means idle and they too had their observations of
Confederates who apparently had heard from Chickamauga,
a favorite shout of theirs across the river being, "How
are you, Rosey?" In the afternoon of the 27th, the Regiment
and the whole Corps again changed locations; the
pickets along the river could plainly see and hear the rebels
at their respective tasks; the work upon their fortifications,
their drills and other occupations. Here it was
that Lieut. Colonel Peirson's detachment found the Regiment
on its return. A short move on the 29th, brought
the Regiment out of shelling range, but in a place so heavily
wooded that trees had to be felled to make camping places,
and on ground so low that very little rain made it extremely
moist. By building bunks, we were enabled to keep out of
the mud, but we were far from comfortable and, to crown
all our discomforture, though there was water everywhere,
as in the case of the Ancient Mariner, we found not a drop
to drink; that had to be brought from a distance. The
fires for cooking and bodily comfort were maintained with
difficulty, and inflamed eyes, through prevailing smoke,
became the rule.</p>

<p>Friday, October 2d, marked a sad day in the annals of
the Divisions; the forenoon had been so rainy that it
seemed as though nothing could add to the discomforts of
the situation, yet the prospect of a march to witness the
execution of a bounty-jumper was not so inviting as it might
have been under less watery conditions. It was about noon
that the Regiment fell into line, and, after standing an hour
under the pelting rain, thoroughly drenched it moved out and
in mud and water seemingly knee-deep marched some two
miles or more to the assigned rendezvous where, after
many changes of position to accommodate other portions
of the Division, the rain having cleared away, the band of
the Sixteenth Maine playing a dirge announced the approach
of the procession; the same consisting of the provost

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">Oct. 3, '63</span>

guard, followed by an ambulance in which rode the prisoner,
sitting upon his coffin, accompanied by his chaplain.
Blindfolded and kneeling upon his coffin, the firing
squad, obedient to orders, discharged their weapons and
the deserter of the Ninetieth Pennsylvania passed on to his
reward; however gruesome the scene may have been,
undoubtedly the lesson was a valuable one upon such as
thought the laws of the land could be broken with impunity.</p>

<p>The return from the execution to a camp, practically
under water, was anything but inspiriting and whatever
was eaten had to be taken out of the haversack, for campfires
were out of the question and sleep to men soaking wet
was hardly possible. The weather clearing during the
night gave some chance for drying garments during Saturday,
the 3rd, and Sunday began to seem endurable and
adapted to letter writing, when there came orders to pack
up, once at least heard with no sigh of regret. While waiting
for orders to march, all ears were startled by the sound
of cannonading, which proved to be an effort of the enemy
to shell a Union wagon train which had driven somewhat
near the rebel works. When the start was made and the
new camping spot found, it proved to be an excellent one,
high and dry, with plenty of wood and water, and by general
consent, the site was first-class; in honor of the Surgeon-in-Chief
of the First Corps, the place was known as "Camp
Nordquist."</p>

<p>At dress parade, Oct. 7th, an order was read to the effect
that men, desirous of changing from infantry regiments to
light artillery batteries, could do so by sending their names
through the proper channels. Much to the surprise of the
officers, there was a very general response to the proposition;
indeed two hundred and twenty-three men, almost
one half of the effective regimental organization, had filled
out papers. Colonel Davis forwarded the long list to division
headquarters with his approval, but the applicants
had so far overdone the matter, nothing came of it, save
that General Robinson in a special order said that the ser<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>vice
must inevitably suffer, if so many men were to go from
one organization, and there the project ended. However
fitting the men found Camp Nordquist, it was not theirs
to remain there long, since after lights had been extinguished
in the night of the 9th and the men were in the
midst of their before-midnight slumbers, there came peremptory
orders to pack up and be ready to march. Quickly
responding, and building great fires for light and comfort,
the Regiment was soon in place and prepared for the next
command. It did not come until the morning of the 10th,
when in obedience to it the Brigade, Division and all, started
out over a by no means easy route and kept in motion
until morning. Finding ourselves in the vicinity of Morton's
Ford, we were ordered to cook breakfast and make
ourselves as comfortable as possible.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter">
    <h2>A BACKWARD MOVE</h2>
</div>


<p>An explanation of the event of this and subsequent days
is in place here; by a singular coincidence, just as Meade
was beginning to do what Lee had been expecting of him,
for several weeks, the latter began a move similar to that
of the year before when he had hurried Pope across the
Rappahannock; in other words, he flanked Meade's right,
thus making it necessary for the latter to end any southern
plans that he may have formed, and to devote himself exclusively
to heading off the Confederate leader. While
the entire Union army is in motion our interest centres
in the Regiment whose story is in progress. As originally
proposed, the First Corps was to cross the Rapidan at
Morton's or Raccoon Ford, co-operating with the Cavalry
which was to cross the river at Germanna Ford, and to
assail the Confederate right; meanwhile the Sixth Corps
was to cross at a point further up the river and to attack
Lee's left. An early attack was the motive for the very
unseasonable start, though its purpose was largely negatived
by the great fires with which the men had lighted
their way through the night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">Oct. 11, '63</span>

All day long the troops awaited the approach of Buford
and his troopers before crossing, but no cavalry appeared;
night approached and preparations for repose were afoot
when the command came to pack up and be off. Evidently
the purposes of Lee had been disclosed and an "About
Face" was only preliminary to "Forward, March."
The night was memorable to those concerned in its exactions,
not so much for its length as on account of the difficulties
encountered. Along a narrow road, infantry and artillery
jostled each other, frequently the former having to take
to the fields, many of them low and marshy, or to lie along
the roadside while the cannon had the thoroughfare. At
last the top of the hills near Mountain Creek, where the
first camp south of the Rappahannock had been pitched,
was gained and an unparalleled scene broke upon the
vision of these sleepy and wearied soldiers. As far as the
eye could reach the entire landscape was starred with
campfires, and it began to look as though we were to sleep
on our old campground. Every conceivable noise saluted
the ear; the stroke of axes as they cut up rails for fuel, the
clamor of teamsters, endeavoring to get their teams through
difficult places and the incessant hum of human voices,
raised for a thousand reasons. It was midnight, however,
before the Thirty-ninth was ready to commit itself to sleep,
and even then, not for long, since at 2 a. m. of the 11th,
the call to arms was heard by the tired and sleepy men.</p>

<p>All may have heard the call, but all did not obey at once.
Some of them had been known to ignore parental rising
calls at home and, on this occasion, they were the happy,
lucky ones, since six o'clock arrived and still no orders to
move forward, though the right of the corps had been long
on the march. The many and rapid changes of the last
thirty-six hours have brought about some hitherto unexperienced
trouble. Many of the Regiment had been left
on picket and one of those, performing this at present
hazardous duty, records the following in his diary, "About
nine (p. m.) receive orders to pack up and leave; march<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
to our old camp and get some rations; then start again
for Pony Mountain. About 3 a. m. (11th), arrive at our
old campground, where we first stopped (Aug. 1) after
crossing the Rappahannock, and I was just ready to lie
down when we were ordered back about a mile to our
Regiment." Not all, however, were so fortunate. Though
under the command of that sterling veteran, Captain John
Hutchins (C), owing to the darkness of the night, some
of the men lost their way and thirteen were captured by
closely following rebel cavalry; seven of the captives
being from "E," the Somerville company, were as follows:
Sergt. J. R. Hyde; Privates F. J. Oliver, Henry Howe,
Joseph Whitmore, Washington Lovett, all of whom died
in Andersonville; and Corp. G. W. Bean and Private J. W.
Oliver; the corporal survived seventeen months of imprisonment,
getting out March '65, while the private, more
fortunate, was paroled after three or four months of durance;
John K. Meade of "K" was also taken the same
night, the event happening near Stevensburg, about six
miles from the Regiment.</p>

<p>The soldier's time honored privilege of grumbling had
free course this afternoon, since it was between 10 and
11 a. m. that the lines finally moved. The hardened campaigner
understands that no one in the regiment is responsible
for unseemly hours of turning out; it means just the
same for shoulder straps that it does for men in the ranks;
the enemy is near; exactly when or where he may appear
no one knows, but all can be ready to respond immediately
to the first command. The chances are that not
even Colonel Davis was aware that to him and his regiment
was to be entrusted a considerable part of the safety
of the rear of the retreating army. Yet such was the case,
and when the fact became apparent not over pleasant
memories of their former experience in a similar duty were
recalled; happily in this case the wagon trains had been
hurried forward and the coast was comparatively clear
all the way to Kelly's Ford, passing on the way all that was

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">Oct. 2, '63</span>

left of the hamlet of Stevensburg. Further down the river
was a pontoon-bridge over which other troops were passing
but, as the enemy was near, there could be no delay
and at 5 p. m., or thereabouts, the men marched through,
the water being about waist deep and, in chilly October,
anything but agreeable. With all possible precautions
taken for defense against the closely following foe, and
with great fires to dry their saturated garments, the soldiers
were soon comparatively comfortable.</p>

<div class="chapter">
    <h2>CAMPAIGN OF MANEUVERS.</h2>
</div>


<p>By way of explanation of the marchings and counter-marchings
in which the regiment is indulging, it should
be stated that a considerable portion of October was devoted
to what Wm. Swinton calls "A campaign of maneuvers."
So far from reading each other's mind, it would appear
that neither Lee nor Meade was accurately informed of
the actual procedure of his rival for, while the Confederates
were still making their way northward, but not being
encountered by Meade where he expected, the latter ordered
the Second, Fifth and Sixth Corps to turn about and to
be ready to face Lee at or near Culpeper; the Third Corps,
under French, meanwhile was at Freeman's Ford on the
Rappahannock, and the First we have seen at Kelly's
Ford. When the Union Commander learned that Lee had
simply gone a little further west for his crossing of the
Rappahannock, White Sulphur Springs, on the 12th, and
was rapidly nearing Warrenton, he recalled the troops
south of the river and then began the forced march to prevent
Lee's distancing him completely. Thomas Nelson
Page says, "Meade was a master at moving his troops
and now, making a forced march that night was in Lee's
rear the next morning"(13th). It was a hotly contested
race as to which army should first reach Bristoe Station,
thus ending any purpose that Lee might have had against
Washington.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>In all these movements on the great chessboard of war
with its army corps, divisions and brigades, what was a
single regiment among so many hundred? How much less
was the individual, and it is the province of a history, such
as this, to keep as near the individual as possible. Even
a brigade, in such a vast array of men, was scarcely more
than a pawn in the mighty game the Blue and the Gray
were playing for American supremacy. Still every regiment
had its part to perform in the progress of the contest,
and thousands of people in the homeland were
watching each and every day's doing with supreme interest,
their thoughts chiefly centered on some particular organization,
and to them and the members themselves there was
no other body quite so important as "ours." To follow
day by day, the march, bivouac and duty of the Thirty-ninth
Massachusetts in this and all other campaigns in
which it had a part is the office of this story.</p>

<p>The white frost that greeted the eyes of waking soldiers
in the morning of the 12th was quite as cold as any that
New England could present, and campfires never were
more appreciated. A hurried breakfast was prepared and
eaten when the brigade was ordered into hurriedly made
rifle-pits, where the day was spent with the understanding
that trouble might arise at any moment. This was the
day in which Meade was looking for Lee. While there
were sounds of activity elsewhere, nothing disturbed the
Thirty-ninth, some even writing letters as the hours passed
on. At no time in the history of the Regiment, did legs
play a more important part than they did on the 13th of
October; called from slumber at midnight, the advance
was begun at one o'clock of the morning, and through the
darkness the blue clad men were pushing forward as rapidly
as possible towards Warrenton Junction, reaching it at 11
a. m., with fifteen miles to the credit of the forenoon's
effort. At Bealton station on the way, at six o'clock three
had been a halt, and the men naturally supposed that coffee
and breakfast were in order, but, much to the disappoint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>ment

<span class="sidenote smcap">Oct. 12, '63</span>

of all, came the order to advance and that, too, without
delay. When men demurred and undertook to continue
their preparation of food, staff officers rushed among
them and, kicking over their utensils, put out the fires,
thus impressing on the hungry fellows the fact that the
march was a forced one. It surely was a hurried getting-away
and many a vehicle came to grief, particularly among
the sutlers who had been somewhat venturesome in their
coming to the front; it was even claimed that misfortunes
to the outfits of the sutlers were not always unprovoked,
since the removal of linchpins by mischievous boys and
the consequent running off of wheels gave opportunity to fill
otherwise empty haversacks.</p>

<p>At Warrenton Junction all preparations were made for
the possible attack of the enemy, batteries being unlimbered,
the Regiment formed in battle-line, though the noon hour,
after the long retreat, suggested dinner to the almost
famished men, but the experience of the preceding July
had taught all that the locality was sadly lacking in water
supply. Except those who were looking out for the rear,
the troops were in active motion, all passing by at the
height of speed. Great quantities of commissary stores
were piled up, and these were either carried off by the
soldiers themselves or loaded upon the trains and thus
saved, so disappointing the enemy who had reckoned on
getting to these food supplies first. After a considerable
halt the march proceeded along the line of railroad past
Catlett's Station to Bristoe's, reaching the latter point
late in the evening and camping at about nine o'clock. On
the way we had passed the great wagon trains of the Army
of the Potomac, packed in one, great, solid square, with
wheels chained together, the mules being secured in the
centre, indicating that the danger of immediate attack
from the enemy was thought to be over for the present
at least, and it also seemed that the First Corps came near
being in the lead. A march of nearly twenty-five miles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
with almost empty haversacks gave the men reason for
being considerably tired.</p>

<p>"Not every boo is a bear" was clearly shown on this
march towards Centreville when Fred, brother of Sergeant
L. of "K," having permission from the colonel, undertook
to secure a chicken for the sergeant whose stomach was
not in accord with his regular rations. With instructions
to be extremely careful, the soldier went from house to
house but without success, the guards at these places telling
him that he was running great risks, since the men, seen in
the distance, were clearly bushwhackers. It was nightfall
before he found the chicken he was after, and by the
time he was making his way back, darkness settled down.
He had to pass through a strip of woods where every object
was distorted and even a deaf man would have heard
sounds. Halfway through the woods, a real noise in
the roadside bushes made his hair begin to rise, but he
did not stop to investigate too closely, when the climax
was reached by six or seven razorback hogs dashing across
the road in front of him. The sudden change from probable
guerrillas to actual swine was a relief unutterable,
but the former were about and that very night carried off
two men from the headquarter's wagon train. While the
sergeant enjoyed his chicken broth and improved thereon,
he declared the risk too great and Fred went on no more
such errands.</p>

<p>It was a four o'clock call of the bugle, in the morning of the
14th, that summoned frost covered and sleepy soldiers
from dreams to realities, but their distress was somewhat
offset by the appearance of rations, of which they drew
supplies for four days and thereby were better equipped
for the day's progress which began at seven o'clock, as one
veracious chronicler states, with the First Corps on the
left and the Sixth at the right of the railroad. While these
two Army Corps were thus continuing their way in relative
quiet, heavy firing in the rear indicated that the
Second and Fifth Corps were having something to do, the

<span class="sidenote smcap">Oct. 14, '63</span>

Second fighting the battle of Bristoe Station; General
Warren having his hands full in warding off the attack of
the enemy while the cavalry, on both sides, were piling up
the portentous list of battles, many of them bloodless,
which adorn the histories of so many mounted regiments.
Centreville, so famous in the July days of 1861, was now the
evident destination of the forces and crossing Bull Run,
at Blackburn's Ford, the scene of the first day's fight in
the memorable First Bull Run engagement, the brigade
arrived at Centreville not far from noon. To build fires
and to prepare a dinner, undisturbed, was the next act
in this day's drama and, if tired soldiers caught a few hours
sleep before the next scene, it need not be wondered at.
Some of the men in the Thirty-ninth were participants
in the disastrous battle of Bull Run; to them it was a case
of old scenes revisited, and if they took some pride in rehearsing
their experiences they did not fail of interested
listeners.</p>

<p>But the day was by no means done; though Centreville
had been reached, the enemy was still near, only a
little way to the west, and picket lines must be established.
Accordingly the Regiment proceeded on its somewhat confusing
task, while the greater part of the division went on
a reconnoisance. Apparently there was little definite
knowledge of localities, since one writer observed that they
reached their destination at seven o'clock and marched
around till eleven, and another of Company E relates the interesting
experience of trying to obey the orders to follow
Bull Run until the pickets of the Sixth Corps were reached.
After crossing Cub Run, three miles away, Major A. D.
Leavitt of the Sixteenth Maine, division-officer of the
picket, went on ahead to ascertain his whereabouts, leaving
the Regiment in a field. Returning in less than an
hour, he reported a rebel camp in the immediate front;
in trying to retire, the line was halted by our own pickets
when it appeared that we had been more than a mile beyond
our own lines. On calling the roll, Sergeant Dusseault<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
found that twelve men were missing. Major Leavitt would
allow no one to go back after them but himself and he
found the missing men fast asleep where we had been
waiting. Bringing them all safe and sound to their own,
established the reputation of the Major with the Thirty-ninth
from that time on, as long as he lived. To one member
of Company E, "Johnny" Locke, the memory of the
Major was specially grateful, because of the latter's kindness.
The young man had been suffering for days from a
carbuncle on his neck; in any other place than the army,
he would have been laid up completely, but here he kept
going; he was one of those found by the officer and, recognizing
the condition of the soldier, he kindly got down
from his horse and mounted the boy in the saddle. Sidney
himself could have done no more.</p>

<p>The dawn of the morning of the 15th did not reveal the
situation with certainty to these inexperienced soldiers;
they knew that they were very near the thrilling scenes
of more than one and two years before, that the sound of
musketry and cannon-firing in their front indicated the
possibility of a third battle of Bull Run. It was theirs, however,
to watch and wait in constant expectation of orders
to lend a hand. One writer enlarges on the delights of
persimmon-eating, the October frosts having ripened the
yellow delicacy to perfection, and the various other diversions
that unoccupied hours ever suggest. Though the
brigade was finally rejoined and there was a movement
towards Centreville with orders to pitch tents, before the
same could be obeyed a long threatened rain began to fall,
putting out whatever fires had been built and essentially
adding to the discomforts and uncertainties of the day.
Rations were drawn late at night and record is made of the
giving out of a portion of whiskey as a stimulant to the
wet and weary soldiers. The experiences of the 16th and
17th did not vary essentially from those of the 15th; there
were picket duty, acting as reserve, the drawing of rations
and all sorts of prognostications as to what the outcome of

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">Oct. 16, '63</span>

the expedition would be. While the cavalry of both sides
kept up an exchange of compliments, very few casualties
were reported from any source. That those who directed
believed there was immediate danger was evident in the
degree of caution constantly maintained; roll-call every
two hours and constant injunctions to be ready to move
at any moment.</p>

<p>The 18th marked the end of the Confederate effort to repeat
the campaign of the preceding June and July, and
that of 1862. General Lee writing to his wife on the 19th
of October says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I have returned to the Rappahannock. I did not pursue with the
main army beyond Bristoe or Broad Run. Our advance went
as far as Bull Run, where the enemy was entrenched, extending
his right as far as Chantilly, in the yard of which he was building
a redoubt. I could have thrown him farther back, but I saw no
chance of bringing him to battle, and it would have only served
to fatigue our troops by advancing farther. If they had been
properly supplied with clothes, I would certainly have endeavored
to have thrown them north of the Potomac; but thousands
were barefooted, thousands with fragments of shoes, and all
without overcoats, blankets or warm clothing. I could not bear
to expose them to certain suffering on an uncertain issue.</p></div>

<p>From the foregoing it would seem that only the Confederate
cavalry had been responsible for the Federal
activity in and about the old Bull Run battlefields, and
now even the horsemen were to follow the foot forces and
the Union troops would again move west and southward.
Ordered out and to pack up in the morning of the 19th
the prospects were not improved by a severe rain storm
which completely drenched both tents and apparel so that,
to regular burdens, was added the weight of water absorbed
by the fabrics. Starting at about eight o'clock, the route
was along the Warrenton turnpike, the very road, so prominent
in all accounts of the two Bull Run fields, with the
sad sights of only partially covered bodies of those who had
perished in the engagements; the severe rain was constantly
adding to the heaviness of the way and Thorough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>fare
Gap, the reputed destination of the march, seemed a
very long distance off. The vicinity of Haymarket on
the Manassas Gap Railroad was reached about 4 p. m.
and the noise ahead indicated a fear that the enemy was
there in force, our artillery keeping up a vigorous shelling
of what was thought to be the rebel position. Camps were
made and tents pitched only to have the vexatious order
"Pack up" given just as we were disposed to get a bit of
rest. Rations, too, were scarce and everything combined
to make the day and night particularly trying; at 3.30
p. m. or thereabouts of the 20th an advance was made
through Thoroughfare Gap, though there were those who
thought "No Thoroughfare," on account of the difficulties
of the way, would be a better designation.</p>

<p>The 21st was spent in camp which was pitched on such
a hilly surface that at least two bunkies had to stake a
board at their feet, lest they slide from under their blankets.
Every one remarked on the beauty of the locality and
comments were made on the five storied flouring-mill
standing in the Gap, the same being thought the finest
edifice yet seen in Virginia. Notwithstanding the recent destruction
of railroads on the Confederate retreat, so quickly
were repairs made and so immediate the communications between
the different departments that a wagon supply train
came through in the afternoon and hungry men were fed
once more. One man said his breakfast had consisted of
half a hardtack; the same writer, his stomach being at
rest, could enlarge on the beauties of the moonlight in the
evening. Poetic thoughts are not prevalent in the presence
of hunger. The 22d brought inspection, an indication
that the officers, at least, thought us anchored for a while;
the 23rd was marked by a battalion drill, another sign of
permanency and, to complete the soldiers' happiness,
quartermaster's stores appeared so that many defects and
wants in uniform were supplied.</p>

<p>While every prospect was pleasing, it was not for sightseeing
that these men in blue were so far from home and

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">Oct. 23, '63</span>

all realized that a long stay here was out of the question, so
the orders to be ready for a start at seven o'clock of the 24th
surprised no one. A very heavy, cold rain had been falling
during a large part of the preceding night, hence wet
tents increased the burdens of travel while empty haversacks
reminded the owner of an equally vacant stomach.
Every day, during an active campaign, reminded all concerned
of the truth of the old adage that an army, like a
snake, moves upon its belly, and Oliver Twist, ever insistent
on more, was reproduced in every healthy soldier in
the Potomac Army. Only the few who had provided for
a possible lacking of rations had anything to eat this morning,
hence no time was lost in preparing breakfast. It was
through a pitiless rain that the day's march, beginning
early in the forenoon, was made back through Thoroughfare
Gap; following the railroad as nearly as possible,
luckily the grade being down rather than up; fording
streams, especially Broad Run, though they could make
the men no more wet than they already were from the
rain; through Haymarket, Gainesville to Bristoe Station,
the scene of the Second Corps' fight on the 14th. On every
hand were evidences of the fierce encounter, as dead horses
and the many graves of the slain. Though the most of
the brigade halted here, the Thirty-ninth and the Ninety-fourth
New York had not reached their limit, and they
continued until Kettle Run was reached.</p>

<p>The special duty assigned to these two regiments was
the guarding of the railroad, which had been repaired to
this point and the bridge which was in process of building;
all were exceedingly tired from the long day's exactions;
there was no food to cook for supper but they could build
big fires and dry to some extent their drenched apparel,
and then seek rest and the sleep which hovers near the
wet and weary. Sunday, the 25th, dawned bright and beautiful,
its warmth imparting sun soon dried what the fires
of the night before had failed to do and, had there only
been rations for the hungry men, they might have been in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
a better mood for enjoyment. Ten of the clock brought
inspection, as inevitable as death itself; before noon the
anxiously expected rations appeared and, with them disposed
of, the Regiment was ready for any duty that might
be assigned. With the food also came some articles of
apparel, so that long needed blankets made nights more
comfortable. For eleven days or until the 5th of November,
this locality, the camp having been changed a bit and
more carefully laid out, became the habitat of the Thirty-ninth.
It was during the night of the 25th that Lieutenant
I. D. Paul of Company F came near losing his life; orders
had been given to those on guard to challenge no one but
to shoot at sight; only the recognition of his shoulder
strap saved the popular officer's falling a victim to the very
orders that he had himself given out.</p>

<p>Though the camp was to continue quite a while for an
active campaign, the men did not know it, nor anyone
else for that matter, so orders to be ready for a move were
not unheard during this period of comparative rest; still
the regular routine of roll-calls, drill, etc., was resumed,
for absolute ease was unknown to members of the Thirty-ninth.
The season being the last of October, the weather
was sharp, the rains cold and need of warm clothing apparent.
The 29th brought quite a rarity in the shape of a
ration of "soft bread" as the soldiers always called the
baker's product, in the shape of loaves, in distinction from
the hard bread or the regulation hardtack, the real standby.
The last day of the month was written down as the date
of muster for two months' pay and the fact that food
was abundant, since, being right on the railroad, by means
of steam, rations came direct from Washington. On Tuesday,
November 3rd, there was a brigade drill, conducted
by Colonel Leonard of the Thirteenth Massachusetts,
commanding the brigade, and the giving out of eight days'
rations had a decided look towards a change of camps.
The 4th was signalized by the arrival of boxes from home

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">Nov. 4, '63</span>

and many a boy's heart, as well as stomach, was made
glad by evidence of home regard and recollection.</p>

<p>While the men regretted leaving their comparatively
comfortable camp, all realized that the mutations of war
demanded almost constant action, so the orders while
battalion drill was in progress to get ready for a move
were not entirely a surprise; besides, the many rations of
the day before were a warning. Arms having been stacked,
tents were pulled down and everything made ready for the
start, which was about 4 p. m., and a large part of the
march to Catlett's station, some seven miles away, was
made after dark, hence tedious, made all the more so by
the burden of extra rations and a winter outfit of clothing
and tent material. Some one has characterised the march
as a helter-skelter one, every man "going on his own
hook," without regard to regimental formation, let alone
so compact a matter as a company; each man camped down
where he could do so most comfortably; "there was no
roll-call that night." The next day the soldiers found
their own, and the Regiment moved half a mile or so from
the night's bivouac and pitched tents on a side-hill, resuming
the routine of regular camp life, and entry is made of
the burning of the tall grass which grew near, necessitating
some energetic work on the part of the campers to extinguish,
and the all too apparent exertions of the preceding
twenty-four hours merited the whiskey ration which was
dealt out.</p>

<p>That no degree of permanency had yet been attained
was evident when early orders were received to be ready
to march at 6.30 a. m. of the 7th, and the start was made
at 7, much nearer than usual to the allotted hour, and the
trend was southward, through Warrenton Junction and
Elktown to the vicinity of Morristown, a few miles from
the Rappahannock. Not only was the entire First Corps
in motion but the same was true of the Second and Third
as well, all indications pointed to a resumption of the status
prior to the October Northward move. Whatever the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
plans or purposes, they were not carried out without provocation
to firing as appeared in the sounds from the river
region; later knowledge acquaints us that the noise arose
from portions of the Sixth and Fifth Corps at Rappahannock
Station and the Third Corps at Kelly's Ford, disputing
possession with the ever present and always vigilant enemy.
The distance marched varied according to the one estimating,
the same ranging from fifteen to seventeen miles.
In October, 4.30 a. m. is a long while before daylight,
yet this was the time of waking on the 8th and, after the
very essential coffee-making, the line was off soon after six
o'clock. The first considerable halt was at Grove Church
where were seen a large number of Confederate wounded
from yesterday's engagements.</p>




<div class="chapter">
    <h2>BRANDY STATION</h2>
</div>


<p>The Rappahannock was crossed at Kelly's Ford by
means of a pontoon bridge and, at 5 p. m., the Regiment
was near Brandy Station, having marched ten or twelve
miles; the route, where possible, was along the railroad
which will be in operation to-morrow probably. Tents
were pitched and large fires built and many were pleased
to find not so very far away the Tenth (Sleeper's) Massachusetts
Battery which we had left at Poolesville and now
is connected with the First Division, Third Army Corps
and which, yesterday, had borne its part in the incidents
of the day. Many a handshake and "Glad to see you"
signalized the meeting. The earlier part of the 9th was
passed in the halting place of yesterday, some of the men improving
the chance to call on friends in the Tenth Battery,
but at two in the afternoon, the familiar "Pack-up"
order was heard with the accompanying direction to be ready
to march at four o'clock. A little before sunset, the start was
made by a countermarch, recrossing the Rappahannock on
the pontoon bridge and a long, wearisome, night trip followed,
one of the features being the first snowstorm of the season,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">Oct. 10, '63</span>

all tending to make a very tired lot of men, who were pushed
along without halting to Licking Run, between Bealton
and Warrenton Junction, possibly fifteen miles from the starting
place, arriving a little past midnight. Very many fell
out on the way quite unable to stand the pace, and those
who did stick to the colors wasted no time in preparations
for camp, but dropped at once and straightway fell asleep.</p>

<p>The morning of the 10th revealed a tired array of men
and a snow-covered earth, but human nature and human
bodies rally readily. After a short move further into a
considerable piece of woods, camp was pitched and preparations
were made for as comfortable a stay as possible,
some of the men expressing the wish that they might remain
a while because of the abundance of wood and water, and
here they were to remain almost two weeks, though from
them the fact was concealed; probably no one knew what
the future would unfold. There was work for many of the men
repairing the railroad, some having to go into the woods
to cut sleepers, others to assist with pick and shovel. This
day, the 10th, the promotion of 1st Sergeant Dusseault,
Company E, was announced and he was assigned to Company
H as Second Lieutenant. Within this period, drills
were resumed and all else that pertained to routine and
efficiency; clothing was drawn, the Regiment was paid for
September and October on the 16th and 17th and by a singular
coincidence the sutler made his appearance at the
same time. Evidently some of the men were in arrears, as for
that matter, most soldiers were wont to be. Considerable
care was taken with the tents of both officers and men,
the idea gaining credence that a prolonged stay might be
made here, but neither army was ready, as yet, for winter
quarters.</p>

<p>Orders to move were circulated on the 22d and at four
o'clock in the forenoon of the 23rd, drowsy men were
summoned from their sleep to pack-up and be ready for
another change, starting from their late camp at about sunrise.
On reaching Bealton, a union was effected with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
remainder of the division and a few miles further, towards
the Rappahannock, camp was made for the night,
all realizing that cold weather was upon them and that the
burdens, on the march by day, had to be heavy in order
to insure any comfort for the night. Rain fell very easily
during those days, and it was somewhat discouraging to
have to turn out at 4 a. m. and, breakfasting at an early
hour, to stand in line momentarily expecting the order,
"Forward," and all the time pelted by the falling rain.
After a while we were ordered to put up our tents again,
a change of mind having been experienced higher up.
Wednesday, the 25th, differed in no essential from its predecessor,
though many of the men were wondering whether
the mail, express or freight, would bring them anything
from home by way of a reminder of Thanksgiving, due
on the 26th. Disappointment was the lot of all, for authorities
in Washington must have known of impending activity
and so withheld what thoughtful friends had attempted
to forward to the army; sutlers however put in an appearance,
an ill-starred act, on their part, as the morrow was
to show.</p>

    <h2>MINE RUN</h2>
</div>


<p>Thanksgiving day in the North, November 26th, should
be remembered as the beginning of the famous Mine Run
affair, one of the greatest of the battles that were never
fought. Judging from results in former years, when campaigning
was undertaken at this season of the year, it would
seem that winter quarters would be a better proposition
for the army than another forward movement, but General
Meade, feeling that the Northern public demanded some
aggressive movement on his part, determined to avail
himself of the withdrawal of Longstreets' Corps and the
remoteness of Lee's remaining Corps, Ewell's and Hill's, from
each other, and to take the offensive. Ewell's men, under
the command of General Jubal A. Early, Ewell being ill,
held the Confederate right, the same resting on the Rapi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>dan

<span class="sidenote smcap">Nov. 26, '63</span>

at Morton's Ford, while Hill's forces in their dispersion
extended fully twenty miles to the southwest. Meade
could lead 70,000 men into the assault, while Lee's troops
were rated at 50,000; the lower fords of the Rapidan were
quite uncovered, Lee depending for defence on a line of
fortifications extending along the left bank of Mine Run,
an insignificant stream, tributary to the Rapidan and entering
the same near Morton's Ford. The words of Robert
Burns concerning the plans of mice and men never had
better application than in the events of the following days.
Had army corps crossed and attacked as projected, considering
the detached, not to say scattered, condition of the
enemy, it seems as though he would have been beaten in
detail.</p>

<p>Had General French and his Third Corps started at the
early hour named in the orders; had not the engineer miscalculated
the width of the stream and so provided too few
pontoons for the bridge which had to be pieced out with a
trestle; had not the banks of the river proved too precipitous
for the artillery which had to go down to Germanna
Ford and even then, if the Corps had not taken a wrong road
and so fallen foul of Confederate General Edward Johnson
and his forces, the entire story of the war might have been
very different from what is written. In brief, the expedition
was scheduled to begin early in the morning of the
23rd, but was delayed by the severe rain of that and subsequent
days. The orders under which the start of the
27th was made were that the Third Corps, General French,
followed by the Sixth, General Sedgwick, should cross
the Rapidan at Jacob's Mills; the Fifth, General Sykes,
followed by the First, General Newton, was to cross at Culpeper
Mine, while the Second, General Warren, was to
cross by the Germanna Ford, between the other fords
named. With ten days' rations carried by the men, General
Meade was justifiable "in cutting loose from his base of
supplies, and undertaking the feat in three columns of seizing
the plank road and turnpike and, by advancing rapidly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
towards Orange Court House, of turning the enemy's works
and compelling him to give battle on ground not previously
selected or prepared."</p>

<p>That the expedition failed is history, its outlines have
often been told in many places; our interest rests principally
in what the First Corps and Thirty-ninth Regiment
were doing during these days of stroke and counter stroke.
General John Newton, commanding the First Corps, in his
report to the Headquarters of the Army of the Potomac,
tersely narrates the doings of each day from Thursday,
Nov. 26th, to Thursday, Dec. 3rd, both dates inclusive.
Leaving the Third Division of the Corps guarding the
Orange and Alexandria Railroad from Rappahannock
Station to Manassas, he advanced the other two divisions
to the Culpeper Mine Ford, getting only one of them across
by seven o'clock; starting at 3.30 a. m. of the 27th, he reached
the rear of Robertson's Tavern a little after 7 p. m.; the
Corps was roused at 3 a. m. of the 28th and put in position
at the left of the Second Corps and Robertson's Tavern;
about seven o'clock the corps was ordered to advance, still
keeping to the left of the Second Corps; advancing in two
lines through the woods to near Mine Run, the enemy was
discovered in line of battle to receive us. Establishing a
picket line, with a little firing of the enemy, the corps
remained in position for the remainder of the day. November
29th, an attack on the enemy being contemplated on
the right and left, General Newton, in the centre, commanded
his own troops and some of the Fifth and Sixth
Corps; at 8 a. m., agreeably to orders, cannonading began
along his front, continuing a short time only; skirmishers
were sent across Mine Run who performed their duties
gallantly, losing in killed and wounded about forty men;
under cover of the picket lodgement, four bridges were
built, for later use if necessary; under advice from headquarters
the pickets were withdrawn to the Federal or
east bank of the Run at 3 a. m. of the 30th and an hour
later fell back to Germanna Ford to cover the crossing of

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">Nov. 26, '63</span>

the Fifth and Sixth Corps. Dec. 1st all of the army recrosses;
Dec. 2d, under orders, leaving a single brigade
at Germanna, proceeded to Stevensburg with the remainder
of the Corps; Dec. 3rd reached Paoli's Mills about
noon and sent a brigade to Kelly's Ford.</p>

<p>Returning to the 26th of November and confining ourselves
to the work of the Thirty-ninth we find the same
awakened at an early hour and starting out before four
o'clock. The Rappahannock was again crossed at the
station of the same name as the river. During a brief halt
on the south side of the stream, Colonel Leonard, commanding
the brigade, read a telegram from headquarters,
announcing the great victory of General Grant at Chattanooga
and at least one soldier remarked, "That's good news
to march on." With hourly halts, the extended march
was not so tiresome as certain shorter though more rapid
ones had proved. About 6 p. m. the Rapidan was crossed
at Culpeper Mine, and ascending an elevation south of
the river, a mile further along, camp was pitched for the
night. Not a few commented on the change from Thanksgiving
Day the year before, and still more remarked on the
difference between the day at home and that passed in
active campaigning; no cases of insomnia were heard of
during the night, for all were tired and sleepy and "taps,"
if sounded, found very few waiting to obey. Eighteen
miles were put down as the distance marched.</p>

<p>Certain men were detailed as pickets, and it was their
duty to see to it that no harm befell their sleeping comrades;
going on duty at ten o'clock last night, they came
off at two this morning (27th) and an hour later the camp
was alert with preparations to depart. Starting a little
before daylight, we marched southward, passing through
a part of the country very near the Chancellorsville battlefield
of the preceding May and of the Wilderness, yet to
be. After striking the Orange and Fredericksburg pike at
eight o'clock in the morning, a halt was called and the men
rested while the wagon and ambulance trains passed. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
march continued till after dark, ending at Robertson's
Tavern with a total distance covered of about thirty miles,
from the starting point of yesterday.</p>

<p>The 28th of November, Saturday, brought a part of the
Regiment under fire. Before daylight an advance of a mile
or so was made, followed by breakfast and the use of pick
and shovel in entrenching and then a still further, though
brief, advance. The sound of the skirmishing comes from
front and battle line is formed; Companies C and E being
detailed as skirmishers, they went forward some 300 yards,
the regiment remaining behind the crest of the hill. As a
Company C participant wrote, "It commenced to rain
very soon and we lay on our bellies and watched the Rebs.;
their sharpshooters watched us closely and some were
wounded. Benj. Dow of our company was shot through
the leg,<a name="FNanchor_G_7" id="FNanchor_G_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a> but the boys were cool and stood their first fire like
veterans; after lying thus all day, cold and wet through to
the skin, we were relieved about eight o'clock and rejoined
the Regiment, tired and hungry; the Rebs. are in good
position and I doubt whether Meade will attack first."</p>

<p>The night that followed, though quiet, brought very
little comfort to the men, thoroughly chilled by the rain
of yesterday and, at 3 a. m. of the 29th, some of them
were stirring to prepare the soldiers' solace, a cup of hot
coffee. Everybody expected to storm the enemy's works
at some time on this day; knapsacks were piled up that
full use of all the muscles might be had. Old campaigners
were writing their names and regiments on bits of paper
and pinning them on their garments for identification since
it seemed sure that the works could not be assailed without
a terrible loss of life. A brigade of the Fifth Corps
formed the first line of battle and our brigade came next;
skirmishing between the rival lines prevailed all day. Shells

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
<span class="sidenote smcap">Nov. 29, '64</span>

even came over from the Confederates, but they drew no
reply from our lines. The rebels having withdrawn across
the Run, the same wider than usual through having been
dammed, formed the line of separation between the blue
and the gray. At nightfall, to shield themselves from the
cold wind, trees were cut down for a shelter, and to the
mercies of the night the soldiers again commended themselves.</p>

<p>Sunday was the last day of the month, and it seemed
impossible that the day should pass without the long impending
assault; three days' rations were distributed and
the men were told that they must make them last five, a
pretty severe exaction from an army which we have been
told moves on its stomach. The attack did not take place,
but there was a deal of activity in arranging the forces
for the projected advance. It was understood by the leading
officers that in the early morn of the 1st of December
there should be a simultaneous cannonading along the
entire line to be followed by an assault by Warren and
his massed forces, to be succeeded on the right by like action
on the part of Sedgwick and his loyal Sixth Corps
followers. The morning of the first day of winter came,
but Warren did not order the assault as expected. To his
practiced eye, the works erected and defended by the enemy
were too strong for the attack and to his judgment Meade,
himself, deferred when he had ridden to the extreme left
and there saw their magnitude and strength. His messenger,
who happened to be his own son, rode with breathless speed
to countermand the orders of the day before and the Battle
of Mine Run was not fought. At nightfall the backward
movement began and at or near midnight, the Thirty-ninth
with many other regiments was at the Rapidan once more.</p>

<p>During the last of these Mine Run days, our Lieut.
Colonel Peirson was in command of the division line of
pickets, being officer of the day, and his experience was
interesting for, entering upon his duties, he rode a white
horse, furnished him at Division Headquarters, riding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
just in rear of the picket line until the plentitude of
the enemy's bullets compelled him to alight and to walk
or crawl the rest of the way. Desiring to cross a little elevation,
he took the precaution, before exposing himself,
of raising his cap upon his sword and, as it was the immediate
target of several rebel bullets, he concluded that a
more circuitous route would be preferable. So cold was
it that men, in their falsely named "shelters" were frozen
to death, as they held on to their posts to which the relief did
not come. On reaching the desired point and, after driving
the enemy across a small stream which he later learned
was not Mine Run but a tributary, with the assistance
of a few pioneers he successfully bridged it for the passage
of troops. In this labor he had the misfortune to fall into
the water and, in a few minutes, was completely clad in
icicles. Colonel Peirson was still advancing his line before
reporting upon the situation, having discovered another
branch of the stream which he was about to bridge, when
the orders to fall back were received.</p>

<p>The retreat is made across the river at Germanna Ford
and to the Thirty-ninth is committed the task of seeing
all safely over. We see the Fifth and Sixth Corps safely
across, then our own troops, including our brigade; finally
the Regiment goes across, all save Companies C and F and
then C is left alone; stragglers have passed over; apparently
the last cavalryman is riding on the further side when
the pontoons are taken up and, in the last boat, the Medford
Company crosses over to join its fellows on the northern
bank. The expected dash by Confederate horsemen did not
take place and, chilled to the bone, the Union army after
a rest of an hour proceeded to Stevensburg or near that
point. Later, finding a suitable camping place, rationless
and wearied, the men sought what comfort sleep might
afford. Some of the soldiers find time to moralize on the
outcome and they secure some satisfaction from the fact
that if they did not assail the enemy, neither did the Rebels
attack the Federals. Years afterward, General Early, in

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">Dec., '63</span>

command in the immediate front of the line held by the
First and Fifth Corps, wrote of the situation, "A direct
attack from either side would have been attended with
great difficulties, on account of the necessity of having
to descend the slopes of Mine Run and then, after crossing
that stream, to ascend the opposite slopes under the fire
of artillery as well as infantry." Very few soldiers have
ever been heard to criticise the wisdom of Warren's judgment
or of Meade's acquiescence.</p>

<div class="chapter">
    <h2>TOWARDS WINTER QUARTERS</h2>
</div>


<p>In the forenoon of the 3rd, the Regiment marches a few
miles to the vicinity of Kelly's Ford on the Rappahannock
where certain log huts built by the enemy and used by
them until driven out on the 7th of November by the
Third Corps are occupied; a diversity of opinion as to
their condition is put down by certain scribes of the period,
though Company C comes up too late to get in at all. Some
of the boys are very certain that winter quarters are to be
right here on account of the nearness of wood and water
but, meanwhile, the old duty of picketing is resumed and
some of the Medford men find their line along the waters
of Mountain Run. For three weeks there is little variation
in daily routine: drills, inspections, parades and the
regular off and on for picket and guard duty. Meantime
everyone finds time to try to retain whatever heat his
fire may induce, but in spite of his efforts, as one boy writes,
"We suffer with the cold every night." On the 5th, came
orders to move, but happily they were soon countermanded.
The 6th brought the sutler again and opportunity to invest
money for creature comforts at exceedingly high rates.
In these days, men are able to exhibit their mechanical ability,
or the want of it, in their efforts to make comfortable
and presentable the cabins in which they expect to pass
the winter. Drills are suspended on the 11th that more
time may be given to work on the huts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>For the 12th and the 13th there are records of the arrival
of boxes from the North; in one case, "The provisions are
all spoiled"; in another, "All right, except the shirts and
drawers which are missing." Had the latter case arisen
while the men were in rebel prisons, the enemy would have
had to bear the blame; it would appear that there were
pilferers also among our own people. The regularity of
the arrival and departure of mails affords these letter-writing
soldiers no little pleasure. The weather is not so
cold as that of New England at this time of the year, but
it varies from bright sunshine to points away below freezing
with an occasional flurry of snow, but however disagreeable
it may be, all realize that it is harder still for the Confederates,
since they are not so well clad as we are. It is
also a time for furloughs and, on the 19th, seven men from
the Thirty-ninth start on a ten days' visit to the northern
homes, the time spent there to be the very happiest in their
entire lives. The 21st had special mention in the diaries,
in that the chaplain attended two funerals of as many men
belonging to the Regiment and that Colonel Davis began
a ten days' leave of absence for a trip to the Bay State.
The 23rd carries the record of wintery weather, made all
the more so by having the ground covered with snow, the
first time in the season, also the surprise for all, in that
they are ordered to have everything in readiness to move
tomorrow at five o'clock in the morning. Sad looks on soldierly
faces follow this announcement, "for it is such a
good place to spend the winter in."</p>

<p>Though awakened at 3 a. m. and formed in line
at 4, it was 8 a. m. before the orders to march were heard.
Not a little grumbling accompanied this departure on a
cold wintry day from semi-comfortable quarters for new
camping places. One man's observations come down to
us thus: "Why couldn't they let us sleep a while longer
and then let us prepare and eat our breakfast, rather than
make us stand in line on such a cold, cheerless morning?"
Had all kept diaries the entries would have differed in no

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">Dec. 24, '63</span>

essential from the foregoing. The day proved to be a good
one for marching and after reaching Brandy Station, the
course was along the Orange and Alexandria Railroad,
through Culpeper Court House to a point possibly four
miles beyond, when it was found that the Regiment had
lost its bearings, thus necessitating a bivouac in a convenient
stretch of woods. The burden of extra winter necessities
and the frozen earth made the eighteen miles' march
a trying one. Though it was "The night before Christmas"
and many thoughts wandered northward to far away homes
where the loved ones dwelt, there was little of the divine
flavor to the night which settled down and enfolded these
armed men, on the very outposts of the Union Army.</p>

<p>Christmas dawned as expected, but it did not seem just
as it would under other circumstances; the "Merry Christmas"
that passed from mouth to mouth seemed to lack
some of the home fervor, yet all put the best foot forward
and, determining to make the best of it, there was more than
one expression of wonder as to whether "We'll be here a
year hence?" Luckily, boxes from home came to cheer
some of the men, a real demonstration of Santa Claus,
and all the more welcome for this reason; the entire First
Corps was included in this movement and the many campfires,
that lit up the night, gave a gloss to what otherwise
might have been cheerless; song and story made the evening
pass rapidly away, and the ever melodious "taps" set
these patriotic North men to slumber and the sweetest
of dreams. There was an inspection in the forenoon of
the 26th and orders to be ready to march in the afternoon.
Starting at 3 p. m., the trip was only about two miles
still nearer the Confederacy, along the railroad, halting
at or near Mitchell's Station, the very last before reaching
the Rapidan; here in a large field the brigade encamped
in column by regiments. Rain falls on the 27th and this,
coupled with the marshy character of the fields in which
the Regiment is camped, makes moist beds for the men,
though they try to obviate the situation by tearing boards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
from an unoccupied house and by the use of boughs and
branches in getting the bunks off the saturated ground.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter">
    <h2>MITCHELL'S STATION</h2>
</div>


<p>In the matter of residents, it could not be said that
Mitchell's Station was exactly densely inhabited, but
where was there ever a girl whom someone did not admire
and, if possible, make her acquaintance? One family, with
the staunchest of German names, in which the sons had
gone into the rebel army, had a father, mother and three
grown-up daughters. When sober, the "old man" claimed
to be a good Union man; when drunk, as was sometimes
the case, he was an out and out Secesh; as to the girls, it
made no difference what their affiliations were; they were
girls and that was enough. One evening, three officers
called at headquarters and asked the privilege of calling
on the Y&mdash;&mdash; girls; "Umph," exclaimed Colonel Davis,
"I verily believe half the officers in the Regiment are there
already, but you may go if you think it will do you any
good."</p>

<p>With the 28th comes Sutler Pullen again and until afternoon
the rain continues; the 29th does not bring the change
of camping place that so many wish. During the day,
Colonel T. F. McCoy (One Hundred and Seventh Penn.),
commanding in the absence of Colonel Leonard, compliments
the entire brigade on the cheerfulness and fortitude
of the men and their endurance in marching in the cold
and stormy weather; he also calls attention to the exposed
position of the brigade, being the nearest the enemy and
warning every one to be on the lookout constantly. On
this day also was promulgated the plan to secure reenlistments
of the men, with the promise of a thirty days' furlough
and a large bounty. The proposition did not appear
to find much favor with the Thirty-ninth, although all of
the men would appreciate that month at home. The 30th
brought orders to be ready to march on the morrow. Decem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>ber

<span class="sidenote smcap">Dec. 28, '63</span>

goes out with mud and moisture much in evidence;
the camp is moved in the forenoon less than a mile, thereby
finding better conveniences in a piece of woods. Major
Leavitt of the Sixteenth Maine musters the Regiment for
pay, and Lieut. Colonel Peirson performs a like act for the
Maine soldiers. Colonel Davis gets back from his furlough,
having walked from Culpeper last night in the dark and
through the mud. Here, then, ends the year with its record
of Gettysburg and Chattanooga, but for our Regiment,
with all its preparation, marching and undeviating performance
of duty, its fiery ordeal is yet to come.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter">
    <h2>1864</h2>
</div>


<p>January 1st the day dawned bright and cold, the weather
having cleared in the night; the mud and the streams
have taken on the repose of winter, but, if any protection
against the inclement season is to be had, the men must
get to work at once and this they do, cutting down trees
to fashion therefrom the primative habitations that the
early settlers of all new countries have had to make. Though
the men do not know it, and though there will be many
rumors of departures, they may even pack up at times yet,
until the last of April, Mitchell's Station will be the P. O.
address of the Thirty-ninth Regiment, but winter in camp
is no trifling matter with a regular routine of camp duties,
besides the necessity of maintaining the utmost vigilance
towards the foe. Hence the building of quarters cannot
be effected in a day or week, in the meantime the ordinary
shelter tent affords only slender protection against the
wind and cold. It is to be a second winter's experience
with our Regiment, hence the building of log huts is not an
innovation; all that is needed are time, tools and material.
For several months the Rapidan is to be the most generally
named stream in the eastern part of the Union, for along
its northern banks are to camp the several corps which
make up the Army of the Potomac and, every day thou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>sands
of letters to far away homes will tell the people there
what is doing down in "Old Virginny." For four months
a thin line of blue will patrol its shores for more than
twenty miles and equally vigilant men in gray, will keep
their watch upon the south side. With the Second Corps
on the extreme Union left, with headquarters near Stevensburg,
the Union army stretches to the westward till it
terminates with the First Corps, which will furnish infantry
pickets on a line of cavalry outposts.</p>

<p>South of the river, the Confederates are guarding an
equal distance, yet there will be very little indication of
hostility, something like an armed neutrality, each line of
sentinels quite content to be let alone; there is however
this difference between the two armies, one has all that
boundless means can supply to make its soldiers comfortable,
the other wanting nearly everything that would contribute
to personal enjoyment. The lack of clothing and
camp outfit had become such that winter with its rigors
became far more an object of fear to the enemy than any
army the Yankees might send against them. Thomas
Nelson Page, in his Life of General Lee, has this to say
concerning the Confederates in camp along the Virginia
Central Railroad:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Lee's army was in a state of such destitution that it is a wonder
that the men could be kept together. Only their spirit enabled
them to stand the hardships of the winter. Barefooted and
hungry, they stood it throughout the long months of a Virginia
winter, and when it is considered that until they joined the army
many of these men had never seen snow, and that none of them
had ever experienced want of adequate clothing, their resolution
is a tribute to their patriotism that can never be excelled. That
Lee himself endured hardships and suffered with them in their self
denial was sufficient for them.... From his camp, General Lee
writes to his wife on January 24, 1864, "I have had to disperse
the cavalry as much as possible to obtain forage for their horses,
and it is that which causes trouble. Provisions for the men, too,
are very scarce, and with very light diet and light clothing, I
fear they will suffer, but still they are cheerful and uncomplaining.
I received a report from one division the other day in which

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">Jan. 1, '64</span>

it was stated that over four hundred men were barefooted and
over one thousand were without blankets."</p></div>

<p>During the early January days, all the time that could
be secured from regular duties was devoted to house building,
and every man worked with a will, since the weather
was extremely cold, the amount of clothing possessed being
insufficient, in the open air, to maintain warmth; some
of the men resorted to the old fashioned practice of putting
a heated stone at their feet to help make them comfortable,
every one thus getting a notion of what it meant to build
homes in the wilderness as so many pioneers had done.
Because of so many of the men in Company C having been
ship carpenters when at home, a large part of the company
was detailed to work on the houses, though the Woburn
delegation (K) was not far behind with its thirteen men
selected to use axe, saw, hammer and plane. The arrival
of packages from home, from time to time, did much to
lessen grumbling and the coming in of seven deserters on
the 6th, barefooted and telling pitiful stories of the conditions
across the Rapidan, made the Yankees more nearly
comfortable just by way of contrast. With big fires burning,
we were sure of one side being warm, even if the other
was almost freezing. However, song and story wiled away
many a long evening before trying to woo the goddess, sleep,
in comfortless shelter tents. In the demands of picket, camp,
regiment and brigade guard there was something in the
guard-way for nearly every man, every day, so the houses
did not grow any too rapidly.</p>

<p>Such entries in the diaries of the period as, "mudded
our hut to-day," would mean little to the novice unless
told that this meant the stopping of the spaces between
the log cob-pile which constituted the walls of the habitation,
with real old Virginia soil, properly mixed with a certain
amount of water and, when plentifully applied, was
warranted to stand indefinitely, keeping out the much
dreaded wind. The same material judiciously mingled
with sticks, staves, boards or boxes made the chimney-exit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
for the smoke produced in the fireplace, which was a necessary
feature of every cabin.<a name="FNanchor_H_8" id="FNanchor_H_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a> Making the quarters for the
squad that was to hold and occupy did not end the enlisted
man's duties, for he had also to take a hand in the fabrication
of similar structures for his company officers and then
to do his part in behalf of the care and comfort of the Field
and Staff. Nor did the chain end here, since there must be
places for the retention and protection of commissary
and quartermaster stores and, never to be forgotten, were
all the important, superlatively useful yet ever railed at,
"The good old army mules," and who should build their
shelters, if not the men for whom they had drawn through
so many miles the supplies which fed and clothed the soldiers?</p>

<p>The long delayed Thanksgiving dinner came to "C,"
the Medford company, on the 10th and a relay of clothing
such as, "Nice flannel shirts and drawers, socks, mittens
and a few caps for nights." The company received them
very gratefully and the friends at home would be more
than paid, could they see how thankful the men were. "We
eat our dinners to-morrow," says the scribe. The details
of the dinner, eaten on the 11th, are not uninteresting; remembering
that twenty-two men had been discharged
from the company, that some men were on detached service
and that many were in the hospital, the fact, that less
than forty were present for duty and the dinner will not

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
<span class="sidenote smcap">Jan. 10, '64</span>

seem so strange. Owing to the limited number, the liberality
of material for that feast is conspicuous; they might
have called in some of their less fortunate neighbors and
then have had a very large meal for themselves; the record
is, "One turkey and one pudding for every four men; one
half a mince pie per man with sauces for turkey and pudding,
also the real old orthodox cranberry, redolent of the Cape,
besides, pickles, cheese and condensed milk." The folks
at home did nothing by halves and how many hours of careful
and diligent labor in those northern homes did this
magnificent layout represent!</p>

<p>Everyday life in these winter-quarter days of the Army
of the Potomac are a practical illustration of the old maxim,
"Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty"; for, despite
the efforts given to hut building, all the men are really
under arms or the next thing to it. "Men are obliged to
wear their equipments twenty-four hours" and an immediate
response is expected to every order. A few recruits
are joining the Regiment, not exactly a pleasant season of
the year in which to be broken into the routine of military
life, yet the proper officers take them in charge and begin the
breaking-in process. On the 12th, remains of the great
Company C dinner are sent over to the sick at Culpeper,
and those who are not users of the weed distribute their tobacco,
also from Medford, among those who are not so
abstemious. Notwithstanding all of the alert watchfulness,
the enemy seems to be perfectly quiescent and, probably,
perfectly willing that we should be. After a deal
of policing and general slicking up, the 16th brings the
monthly inspection, conducted by Lieutenant Bradley
of the brigade staff. The habits of the far off homes are
fixed and in the evening of Sunday, the 17th, might be
heard the sound of many voices as they joined in singing
the songs and hymns of childhood; "a splendid, moonlight
evening."</p>

<p>Deserters and contrabands are frequently discovered
fording the Rapidan, whose chilly waters have less terrors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
for the escaping parties than the tribulations left behind.
In the night of the 19th the firing of the Confederate guards
hastened the steps of some deserting rebels and prevented
the departure of others. The cabins having been constructed
and occupied, the men are now making corduroy sidewalks,
by laying moderate lengths of poles side-by-side,
crossways of the walk itself, and, thus, are able to get about
without being lost in Virginia mud. Many a remark is
heard on the admirable appearance of the camp, all agreeing
that it is the best in the brigade, and some even lay
that claim as against the entire Army of the Potomac.
Company H and a part of "K" go out on a reconnoisance,
Thursday, the 28th. Towards the end of the month, unusual
stir is observed among the enemy, apparently fresh
troops are replacing those long on guard, possibly through
fear that all of the latter will desert; our own camp also
has a spell of falling-in according to orders and, on the
29th, we packed up at 5 a. m., stacked arms and awaited
further orders, sorry enough at the prospect of quitting
the comfortable quarters, so recently completed. Fortunately
for us, it all blew over and the Second Brigade
moved instead. On this same day our eyes were gladdened
by the unusual sight of a lady in camp, the same being
the wife of General Maj. John Newton, commanding the
First Corps, who accompanied the General and Division
Commander, General Robinson, and their respective staffs,
all on a tour of observation. A dull, though not stormy
day closed the month with regular inspection and we see
a Confederate major and three men brought in as captives
by the cavalry.</p>

<p>February starts off full of rumors as to the future of the
Regiment; one says it is to join an expedition to Texas;
another sends us home to be recruited to full ranks, while
still another sends us back to become a part of the Sixth
Corps. Who can explain the starting of so many baseless
reports? The weather, early in the month, is cold yet
there are few breaks in regular routine, if parades, drills

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">Feb. 1, '64</span>

and inspections can be injected between the many calls
for picket duty. A hospital is in process of erection near
the surgeon's quarters and it is a fine building, considering
the circumstances under which it is going up. There
is talk, also, of a chapel or schoolroom for the use of officers
and men. The 5th of the month, late at night, came the
summary orders to be ready to move early in the morning,
reveillé to be at 3 a. m. The drawing of rations, etc., kept
us busy until one o'clock in the next morning, hence not much
sleep, but no end of grumbling. Reveillé sounded according
to programme on the 6th; the men turned out, cooked
their breakfasts, packed their tents and were ready to
start before daylight. At seven o'clock the orders came to
replace the tents and to resume regular camp life. This
break in the usual calm was explained as an incident in the
movement of the Second Corps to Morton's Ford, on the
Rapidan, as a supplementary act to the proposed attempt
of General B. F. Butler from the south against Richmond.
As Butler's plan proved abortive, activity on the part of
the Second Corps subsided at once and things were soon
as they had been.</p>

<p>Sunrise, gilding the snowy tops of the Blue Ridge Mountains,
awakens the sensibilities of some of the men as the
10th day of the month begins and, later in the day, the
paymaster makes all happy with compensation for services
rendered up to December 1st. General Robinson and staff,
accompanied by ladies, also by some of the corps staff officers,
rode into camp on the 12th, evidently thinking it
one of the show places of the cantonment. Over the fact
that the men left in camp, the Regiment being on picket, are
all merged in two companies and these go on dress parade
prompts one commentator to remark that he supposes if
only one man were left in camp, he would have to appear
at the regular time on parade. Injudicious use of the
ardent was the probable reason for the advent of a Thirteenth
Massachusetts' party evidently bent on mischief.
Whatever they came for, the colonel cut short the career<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
of a sergeant and a private by placing them under arrest
and so returning them to their Regiment. How strange it
is, that men will tolerate an evil that makes such fools of
them! The evening of this day was brilliantly illuminated
by great forest fires on both sides of the Rapidan. The
coming of Major William Thorndike, the new surgeon, is
chronicled on the 15th; Surgeon Calvin G. Page, on account
of disability, had been discharged Nov. 16, 1863. The
16th is so cold that large quantities of wood are brought
in from the forest for the building of fires just for the
warmth thereof. The new hospital is opened and much is
expected from it.</p>

<p>The 20th of February marked the dedication of the new
chapel, whose building had taken the time and strength
of the soldiers, some of them, for a number of days. Nicely
decorated and appointed, the men were not a little proud
of their place of worship. Chaplain French had charge of
the exercises; the band of the Sixteenth Maine was present
and most obligingly discoursed appropriate music.
Among the people who crowded the interior were Colonel
Leonard of the Thirteenth Massachusetts with his wife,
Surgeon Alexander of the Sixteenth Maine and wife, with
others. Compliments were dealt out to the men who had
labored so zealously for the success of the project and
Colonel Davis' remarks in this direction were especially
happy. The next day was Sunday, and regular service
was held in the new chapel. Apparently the 22nd, Washington's
birthday, received no special attention. The new
chapel afforded most excellent quarters for the regular
meetings of the Masonic Lodge which had been one of the
features of the Regiment for considerably more than a year.
As far back as Offutt's Cross Roads, November 20, '62, the
lodge had been instituted, under a special dispensation
from the Grand Lodge of Massachusetts, Grand Master,
William D. Cooledge, the document bearing date, November
13, 1862.</p>

<div class="chapter">
    <h2>MASONIC LODGE</h2>
</div>


<p>This original meeting was held at the regimental headquarters,
Colonel Davis presiding, he having been named
as Worthy Master of the Putnam Army Lodge, No. 8,
thus called in compliment to the East Cambridge Lodge
of which he was a member. It appears that army posts
were no innovations at this date as the number of this
new one would indicate. Already lodges had been formed
in the Third, Sixteenth, Seventeenth, Twenty-fifth, Second
and Forty-eighth Massachusetts Regiments and later
dispensations were granted to the Forty-second and the
Thirty-second. Aside from the Master of Putnam Lodge,
Colonel P. S. Davis, the officers were Henry B. Leighton,
S. W.; Capt. Geo. S. Nelson, J. W.; Capt. F. R. Kinsley,
Treasurer; Lieut. Julius M. Swain, Secretary; Daniel
Henry, S. D.; Perry Coleman, J. D.; Lieut. Henry F.
Felch, S. S.; Lieut. Wm. T. Spear, J. S.; Lieut. Willard
C. Kinsley, Marshal; and John M. Curtis, Tyler. In the
distribution of officers it would seem that army rank had
no place, fraternal relations being the only line of consideration.
By-laws for the proper management of the lodge
along with blank forms for application for membership
were adopted and, though the Third Thursday of each
month was named as the regular meeting date there were
far more special than regular assemblings.</p>

<p>The second meeting of the lodge was in the Methodist
chapel and when the Regiment moved back to Poolesville,
the schoolhouse there was utilized, proper secrecy being
gained by putting on guard, near the place of meeting,
members of the order. Applications for membership came
in rapidly and the record for the remainder of the calender
year was twenty-three candidates admitted and seventeen
meetings, $580 being received for dues and degrees.
From April 6 to July 15, in front of Petersburg, after the
death of Colonel Davis, there was a lapse; then the Lodge
voted to bear the expense attending the return of the Colo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>nels'
remains to Massachusetts but, at the request of the
family, the part of the lodge was confined to embalming
and transportation to Boston, along with the expenses of
Chaplain French, who accompanied the body on the sad
journey to Boston. Help was given to the families of comrades
who had been killed or were in hospitals or rebel
prison. October 16, '64, at Fort Dushane it was voted
to pay the expenses of sending the body of Lieut. Wm. T.
Spear, Company B, to Roxbury, the officer having died
in hospital from wounds; the same consideration was
shown to the remains of Lieut. Willard C. Kinsley when
he was killed. The final meeting of the lodge was in the
State House Boston, January 29, 1866, with fourteen members
present when it was voted that of the remaining funds,
$198, $50 should go towards a portrait of Colonel Davis
and the rest for relief. The officers were given the regalia
that they had worn; the Bible was given to the widow of
the Colonel, the square and compasses to the East Cambridge
Lodge, the remaining set to go to Brother Henry
B. Leighton, the S. W. During the activities of the field,
the Master, S. D., J. S. and Marshal were killed, the
Treasurer and Secretary were captured. There are recorded
considerably more than fifty names of those voted in,
while the brother, turning in the records, says that thirty-nine
took the three degrees.</p>

    <h2>MITCHELL'S STATION AND THE SCHOOL IN
    CAMP</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3">Channing Whittaker, Company B</p>


<p>Our most ideal winter's camp before the Wilderness
Campaign was that at Mitchell's Station. A more perfect
parade and drill ground could not have been desired.
It had abundant length and breadth. It was the smooth
level top of an extensive plateau. The log cabins of the
officers were in a straight row where the slope to the rear
began. The log cabins of the men stretched down the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">Feb., '64</span>

slope toward a veritable Eldorado of firewood and drinking
water. These log cabins were very comfortable. Each
accommodated eight men. The entrance from the company
street was at the middle of its length. The fireplace
and chimney were directly opposite the entrance. The
living room was between the two. There were four bunks,
two at each end with one above the other. Each bunk
was long enough for a tall man to stretch out at full length
with his head upon his knapsack and wide enough for two
men to sleep comfortably, side by side. The cabins of the
field officers had, of course, the right of the line. The
chapel was more to the front and a little to the left of the
cabins of the field officers. The pioneers who constructed
Col. Davis' cabin and the chapel were master workmen.
No keel of ship in New England shipyard had timbers
hewn and dowelled into a substantial whole with more
absolute perfection. I never shall forget the perfect delight
of an afternoon when, convalescing from a severe
attack of measles, I was detailed to report at the Colonel's
quarters. Here I was received by Lieut Colonel Peirson
with a smile upon his face. He showed me that the cabin
was not yet dry enough for occupancy, showed me the
wood which I was to burn to dry it out, showed me the
charming fireplace in which I was to burn it. If I remember
well its top was arched. Perhaps the arch had blocks,
with a central one of keystone shape. He gave me a comfortable
seat and an entertaining book to read, by an army
chaplain, "The Whip, Hoe, and Sword," by George H.
Hepworth. The friendly behavior of the Lieut. Colonel,
the restful charm of the roomy clean interior finished in
natural wood showing its grain, the blazing fire in the
big fireplace with its perfect chimney, and the extreme
comfort of it all, after the discomforts of the measles, filled
me with agreeable sensations and with gratitude to the
Lieutenant Colonel.</p>

<p>And the chapel! It may have been thirty by fifty feet
inside. Its hewn oaken logs were perhaps twelve inches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
square, its roof was a fly that the Christian Commission
had furnished. Its fireplace was huge, magnificent. The
prayer meetings were held in it, the Freemasons used
it as a lodgeroom, the Sons of Temperance had meetings
there, and the regimental school for those who could
neither read nor write nor cipher was held in it. I well
remember the morning when Comrade John F. Locke, of
Company E, and myself were detailed to report at the
chapel and appointed to be the teachers of the school by
Lieut. Colonel Peirson. I remember hearing the roll-call
of the students of my own and of a neighboring company
and the ugly mutterings, the dissatisfaction, the almost
mutinous emphatic expressions of discontent of some of
those whose names had been called, because they had been
detailed to attend a school. I fully expected trouble. A
considerable number of men were in anything but a teachable
spirit. We met in the chapel, the Lieut. Colonel, the
teachers, and thirty students, some of them bristling with
unwillingness. But the Lieut. Colonel, who was always
a gentleman, drew us all into a comfortable semi-circle
about the hearth where the cheerful fire blazed. He told
us of the personal benefits and advantages which it was
hoped that the work in the school would bring to each
student, and his manner and speech almost immediately
disarmed the embryo antagonism of the others in the
group. When he finally asked if there were any present
who desired to be relieved from attendance at the school,
not a man wished to withdraw, all were glad of the opportunity.
The antagonism had melted away like a mud-puddle
in the light of a July sun. And the antagonism
never returned. I have taught many hundreds of students
since but none who were more interested, more attentive,
more constant. Each of the men learned to write
his name. Seven wrote letters home before we broke
camp, to the great delight of themselves and their families.
Twenty-three made especially commendable progress in
reading and arithmetic. Our text and copy books had been

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">Feb., '64</span>

the generous gifts of Colonel Davis and his brother Robert.
The Lieut. Colonel had offered a gold pen and case as a
prize to the man who should gain the greatest proficiency
in writing. All of the written exercises were carefully
preserved from the beginning and, when the time came to
award the prize, it was almost impossible to say whether
it had been won by Johnny Gibbs of Company A, a brick
layer, who was well along in years or by Daniel Lines, a
carriage painter. For year after year the good right hand
of Johnny Gibbs had clasped the small handle of a trowel.
Its active exercise in that cramped position with the acrid
lime sometimes in contact with it had caused its bones
and cords and muscles to grow out of shape. He could no
longer open it much more than enough to enter and remove
a trowel handle. He could not hold a pen in usual position.
There were sharp crooks made at the joints of his
right thumb and forefinger when he brought them together,
and there were similar crooks in his capital O's when he
wrote his best. But his handwriting, though characteristic,
was absolutely clear. It was perfectly easy to read.
He had mastered his hand for the purposes of a writer.
Despite the crooks he wrote a handsome hand. The hand
of Daniel Lines had gained a wonderful cunning in the
business of a carriage painter. He could do what he would
with a camels-hair brush, when making scrolls and stripes
and decorations. He brought to his copy book the artistic
power of a hand over which he had a complete control.
From the beginning his double-reversed curves were lines
of beauty. At the end his writing had almost the perfection
of the copyplate. There was no possible doubt that
Daniel Lines' writing was more beautiful than that of any
other pupil in the school, but which had gained the greatest
proficiency in writing in the school, he or Johnny Gibbs?
The teachers were puzzled. They called in the Lieut.
Colonel as referee. He too was in doubt and suggested
that Gibbs and Lines should draw lots. The lot fell to
Gibbs. On Sunday, the 21st of August, 1864, Johnny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
Gibbs and his teacher, John F. Locke, were taken prisoners
in a battle on the Weldon Railroad. They were both very
sick, together, in that fearful prison in Salisbury, North
Carolina. There were no tender-hearted, white-capped,
trained nurses there, to keep in extreme cleanliness the
clothing of the very sick. But the gratitude, the compassion,
the sympathy of the old man for his youthful teacher
became too strong. Like many another soldier who has
volunteered to dare almost certain death in a forlorn hope,
weak Johnny Gibbs washed the soiled clothing of John
Locke. Within a day, Johnny Gibbs was dead.</p>

<div class="chapter">
    <h2>STILL IN CAMP.</h2>
</div>


<p>Incessant picket duty has marked the month of February
with a great variety of weather and the men are not sorry
to see the 29th day, Leap Year's allotment, for they know
that they are just so much nearer the end of the war and
their consequent return to their homes. A spring feeling
begins to be felt on both sides of the river and indications
of activity are discovered among the Confederates, and at
least twice recently orders have been given for the preparation
of rations for the haversacks, as though some sort
of a move were contemplated. On this final day of the
month, the Regiment is mustered for two months' pay,
while drill, inspection and parade have their accustomed
places. Doubtless very few are aware of the hardening
effect upon the bodies of the men this regular and constant
round of discipline is having; the same will appear in the
exactions of the coming months. While February is expiring
thus quietly with our Regiment, in the First Corps
Kilpatrick is making his famous raid towards Richmond,
having started on the night of the 28th, crossing the Rapidan
at Ely's Ford and, with Colonel Dahlgren's forlorn
hope, is entering upon a project which will make history
rapidly. To cover this attempt, a diversion of Confederate
attention is made by the Sixth Corps and a cavalry force

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">Feb. 29, '64</span>

under Custer. Passing through the camps of the Third
Corps, Sedgwick and his men move out towards Madison
Court House, while Custer and his mounted force push
on to Charlottesville, where, on this final February day,
hostile forces are contending within sight and sound of
Monticello, the home and the tomb of Jefferson.</p>

<p>March started off rainy and cold with usual rumors as
to immediate orders for some sort of a move, but duty
on the picket line continued just the same, and not a few
remarked on the discomforts of those who had gone out to
Madison Court House and were compelled to bivouac in
the snow, into which the rain had changed. For the 2d
day of the month, the return of the Sixth Corps and its
cavalry accompaniment was chronicled, along with the
fact that nothing had been heard from Kilpatrick. Even
in wartimes, it did not always rain and the 3rd, being "a
splendid day," some of the men climbed up the sides of
Cedar or Slaughter Mountain for the view, and to look up
traces of the fierce encounter, August 9, 1862, when the
Second and Third Corps, Generals Banks and McDowell
respectively, all under General John Pope, were beaten by
"Stonewall" Jackson and his men. Having encamped so
long under the shadow of the eminence, the trip was particularly
enjoyable and there was no difficulty in locating many
of the prominent features of the bloody day which served
as a prelude to the still bloodier battle of Second Bull Run.
A two hours' brigade drill on the 4th, under Colonel
Leonard, took all available men to the extensive plains
across Cedar Run. As an illustration of the degree to
which neatness was carried, it should be stated that from
their respective company funds pay was given to men, detailed
for the purpose, who should do the company washing,
hence no excuse for uncleanliness would avail thereafter.</p>

<p>Sunday, the 7th, marked the relief of the Second Brigade
on picket, and its return by train to Culpeper, while the
First Brigade took its place. An order, promulgated March<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
10th to the effect that all women in the camp must depart
at once, was taken as a sign of increased activity and the
next day saw the departure of the visiting betterhalves for
their northern homes. Further indication of active campaigning
appeared on the 12th when the Colonel issued
an order directing the several captains to send back to
Washington all dresscoats. John S. Beck, Company C,
entered in his diary, the 14th, "In the evening, took
the Second Degree in Army Lodge, No. 8, and Free and
Accepted Masons," an unusual incident in army life; two
nights later, he took his Third Degree. St. Patrick's Day,
or the 17th, secured no recognition in camp, though large
fires on the rebel side of the river betokened something
doing there, yet the afternoon's sun, lighting up the hillside
on which the Confederates were encamped, revealed
their tents still in place. The 18th, in the afternoon,
witnessed no end of hurry and bustle as all effects were
packed, even to removing tents from the cabin roofs, and
all were to be in readiness to move at once. It was the
general agreement that Stuart and his lively followers
were surely in the saddle. With stacked arms and expectant
hearts, the next order was awaited and, at 5.30 p. m.,
it came, not to fall in and "Forward," but the bubble-burst
words heard so often, "As you were," with a resumption
of regular camp routine and duties.</p>

<p>The signing of pay-rolls on the 19th was a sure sign of
the approach of the paymaster and the perfection of the
weather gave light hearts to all, though a clergyman of the
Methodist Church South, seized outside our lines for conducting
certain of Stuart's men to the capture of one of
our pickets may have had a leaden heart as he was dispatched
on his way to Washington, there to account for
his conduct; bearing the name of Garnett, he must have
belonged to one of the best families of the Old Dominion.
The 20th was Sunday, not usually a pay day, but were
there signs of activity it was thus employed and, as the
paymaster came on this date, the event was considered a

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">Mar. 20, '64</span>

pretty sure sign of a movement; so late did he begin, it was
8 p. m. before the last company was reached. Much to
the disgust of all who had thought winter over and past,
snow began to fall on the 22nd. By nightfall the ground
was white with it, the wind blowing as in an old-fashioned
"nor'-easter," so that the on 23rd there was a foot of
snow lying around and all hands had to turn out and shovel
the same out of the streets and from the parade ground,
which was quite ready for the dress parade of the late
afternoon.</p>

<p>To the Regiment, however, the most important event of
the day was the rearrangement of the several corps constituting
the Army of the Potomac, though this act had
no immediate effect upon the regular life of the Thirty-ninth.
The First Army Corps of the Potomac Army,
commanded successively by Generals McDowell, Hooker,
Reynolds and Newton, had left an excellent record through
the nearly two years of its existence; the disk which, in
red, white and blue, represented its several divisions,
had ever been a badge of honor and now the advent of
General Grant to the command of the army was to bring
about various changes, among them the merging of the
First Corps with the Fifth; its three divisions, reduced
to two, became the Second and Fourth under Robinson
and Crawford respectively while Warren, of late temporarily
in command of the Second, was assigned to lead
the Fifth Corps, and Newton
<a name="FNanchor_I_9" id="FNanchor_I_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a> who had succeeded Reynolds

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>

at Gettysburg, was relieved. Under the same general
orders, the Third Corps also was disbanded, its first and
second divisions going to the Second Corps, its third division
to the Sixth, and General Sykes, the Commander, to
the command of the District of South Kansas. There
were thus left the Second, Fifth and Sixth Corps in the
Potomac Army, to which in the campaign of 1864 the
Ninth Corps, under General Burnside, was to be added.</p>

<p>This rearrangement of army relations was not accomplished
without some heart-burning and many adverse
remarks. John D. Billings in his story of the Tenth Massachusetts
Battery says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Next to the attachment men feel for their own company or
regiment, comes that which they feel for their corps. All the
active services that we had seen was in the Third Corps, and its
earlier history and traditions from the Peninsula to Gettysburg
had become a part of our pride, and we did not care to identify
ourselves with any other. If such was our feeling in the matter,
how much more intense must have been that of the troops
longer in its membership, whose very blood and sinew were incorporated
with the imperishable name it won under General
Sickles."</p></div>

<p>The farewell of General Newton to the men of the First
Corps bears date of March 25, 1864, and is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Upon relinquishing command I take occasion to express the
pride and pleasure I have experienced in my connection with
you, and my profound regret at our separation. Identified by
its services with the history of the war, the First Corps gave at
Gettysburg a crowning proof of valor and endurance, in saving
from the grasp of the enemy the strong position upon which the
battle was fought. The terrible losses suffered by the Corps in
that conflict attest its supreme devotion to the country. Though
the Corps has lost its distinctive name by the present changes,
history will not be silent upon the magnitude of its services."</p></div>

<span class="sidenote smcap">Mar. 26, '64</span>

Though the Thirty-ninth had borne no part in the battle-trials
of the corps, save in the premonitions at Mine Run,
yet its marchings and campings, during eight months of
service, had done much towards impressing upon the Regiment
the character of the corps and an appreciation of the
corps and an appreciation of its excellent record.</p>

<p>Foundation facts for the coming summer are coming
fast in these days for, on the 26th of March, General U. S.
Grant established his headquarters at Culpeper, a little
south of those of the Army of the Potomac. For just a
month, the General's name has been heard in the public
ear more than usual since, on the 26th of February, the
bill restoring the grade of lieutenant-general became a law;
on the 1st of March, General Grant's name was sent to
Congress and it was confirmed March 2nd; on the 3rd, he
was ordered to Washington to receive his commission
and he started the day following. March 9th, in the White
House, in the presence of the President's Cabinet, his staff
or such as were with him and his son, Fred, General
Grant received his commission from the hands of Lincoln,
with the briefest possible exchange of compliments. The
Thirty-ninth Regiment knew it not, but on the 10th, the
Lieutenant-general was at Brandy Station viewing some
of the scenes that were to be better known by him in
approaching days; the next day he was in Washington
again and in the evening started back to the west. Many
plans were evolved by Grant and his lieutenants before
his return to Washington on the 23rd, whence he went
to Culpeper as before stated. Henceforth his military
record will be a part of that of the Potomac Army.</p>

<p>While this is strictly a story of the Thirty-ninth Massachusetts,
of any happening in the camp of our near neighbors
and good friends, the men of the Sixteenth Maine,
passing mention is due here. Colonel Charles W. Tilden
had been captured at Gettysburg and had been held prisoner
in Richmond until the 10th of February, when with
others he got away from Libby through General A. D.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
Streight's famous tunnel and on the 28th of March, at four
o'clock in the afternoon, he was received by his old boys
with a heartiness which only old soldiers can give to the
tried and true; in the evening followed a feast in the regimental
chapel, attended by the officers of the Sixteenth
and the field officers of the brigade, all uniting in the most
fervent expressions of respect and admiration; the history
of the Sixteenth has this concerning the words of
our esteemed Commander, "Colonel Davis, whose encampment
is a paragon of neatness and comfort, replied in his
calm and witty way to a toast complimentary to the Thirty-ninth
Massachusetts." The next day several hundred
men from other regiments in the brigade assembled at 9
a. m. to witness the presentation to Colonel Tilden by
his regiment of a magnificent black stallion duly caparisoned;
evidently the officer was greatly admired. The
remainder of the day was one of diversion for the men
of the Sixteenth and their friends.</p>

<p>The One Hundred and Seventh Pennsylvania, a member
of our brigade, whose Colonel, Thos. F. McCoy, at times
commanded the brigade, pretty generally enlisted in the
month of February, but its re-enlistment home-going did
not begin until this day; surely no April Fool's occasion
for the happy men who crowded aboard the train which
was to carry them hence, all intent on the happiness in
store for them; the "battle summer" will be well under
way before the regiment rejoins us; a considerable part
of the One Hundred and Fourth New York also started away
on a similar errand. On the 3rd, the Ninetieth Pennsylvania
came over from the Second Brigade and occupied the camp of
the One Hundred and Seventh. The general harshness of the
season marked early April, rain and snow, and not till
the seventh day did the weather clear up effectually and, even
then, as matters shaped themselves, there were those who
claimed that there was an improvement, not so much on
our account as that there might be a bright day for General
Grant's inspection. It was Fast Day, too, at home, but

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">Apr. 8, '64</span>

we were eating all we could get. We were out early and
active on the 8th, doing very thorough policing. We
were in line at 11 a. m. and before noon, the hero of
Vicksburg, accompanied by his staff and General Robinson,
appeared, receiving three cheers from the men as he
rode by us; he took a look at our camp and highly complimented
its appearance. Evidently the General had
heard of our camp for he went down through the company
streets which were spick and span as usual. Then he went
out to the picket-line and thence to the signal station on
the hill, Colonel Davis going with him. Everyone was sizing
him up and making some sort of a mental entry concerning
him, and one man wrote this, "He has a good,
resolute look." There seemed to be a general opinion that
he was no great talker, but that, as a doer, he would probably
be all right.</p>

<p>Stormy weather was resumed on the 9th and continued
almost every day until the excess of water washed away
bridges between us and Washington to the extent of stopping
trains on the 11th, with consequent lack of mails and
other inconveniences; so efficient, however, were the
artificers of the army, the very next day trains resumed
running and letters from home made glad the hearts of
men. During these days we were packing all superfluous
articles, preparatory to sending to Alexandria, at the same
time all were enjoined from writing about this to the friends
at home. The new management did not believe in the
utmost publicity. Saddened reflections followed the departure
of the sutler, on the 16th, since thereafter, it
would be necessary to forego luxuries altogether. The
19th saw seven discouraged rebels come into our lines,
saying that there were many more waiting a chance to
get through. Notwithstanding this, we could see that the
enemy was working hard on making breastworks, evidently
expecting us to march directly upon them; nobody knows
just what way we shall advance, but it probably will not be
by the line surmised by the Confederates. Everyone felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
better on account of the serenade that the band of the
Sixteenth Maine favored us with in the evening of the
20th. The 21st marked the departure of thirteen men
from the Thirty-ninth, transferred to the Navy, many of
whom, being familiar with nautical duties, fancied that
service afloat would be preferable to that ashore.</p>

<p>The Cavalry had been even more active, if possible, than
the Infantry during the winter and General Sheridan commented
on the lean and hungry look of the horses when
he reached the army, but in spite of leanness, this branch
was the first to move&mdash;some said it had not stopped moving,-and
on the 23rd, one man wrote, "The Cavalry
moved out to-day" and, could he have foreseen the service
that the restless "Little Phil" was to exact from the horsemen,
doubtless he had written more at length. He also
entered in that same journal, "The covering of our chapel
was taken off to-day, so I suppose our meetings are over."
Dismantling was the order of Sunday, the 24th, and unroofed
cabins lost their homelike look. The move of the
26th looked much like an abandonment of our long time
camp and the beginning of active warfare, for the whole
brigade, leaving the old camp behind, crossed Cedar Run
and, at a point a mile away from the former stopping place,
pitched its shelter tents in column by companies, the thirty-ninth
Regiment being on the right. Some went back to
their old quarters to bring thence boards to help out their
sleeping facilities. By this change of camp, it was expected
to free the men from all surplus stuff and, at the same time,
to re-inure them to the hardships of active campaigning.
The remaining days of April were uneventful, given to
parades, inspections and drills, wherein knapsacks figured
largely, thus testing the endurance of the soldiers and on
the 30th, Saturday, the Regiment was mustered for two
months' pay, March and April.</p>

<p>No month in the year among dwellers in northern regions
prompts to brighter, happier thoughts than May; in
distant Massachusetts, children who had sought the fragrant

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">Apr. 30, '64</span>

arbutus through the daylight hours, were repining
that Sunday made it impracticable for them to hang May-baskets
when the evening shades appeared, a pleasure deferred
however only till the following night. To the men
and boys, afar from familiar scenes and cherished friends,
the pleasures of peace were denied, and being on the eve
of departure, much of regular camp life was omitted.
Their neighbors, the Sixteenth Maine, formed in hollow
square and had religious services, but letter writing was
the most serious employment for the men of the Thirty-ninth.
Could they have known the horrors through which
they were to pass before another Lord's Day returned,
with what eloquence had those messages teemed which
carried simply the usual words of love and fealty. Hands
that wrote tender words on this May day, ere another week
had passed, were folded on soldierly breasts, asleep in
battle-made graves. For nearly an entire year, with no
long rest in winterquarters, no respite from the noise of
combat, the men of the North and their brothers from the
South are about to engage in a death grapple, and a baptism
of blood awaits the tyros of the Lynnfield camp, the
cadets of Edward's Ferry and Poolesville, the Capital
guardians of Washington, and the admirably equipped
soldiers of Colonel Davis' pride.</p>

<p>Though it is the 2d day of May and we are in the supposedly
"Sunny South," snow is plainly visible on the tips of
the Blue Ridge and where the mountains are high enough,
anywhere snow may be found the whole year round. Company
E, Somerville, is taking the least bit of pride to itself
in that its Captain Kinsley, the senior officer of that rank,
commands in the battalion-drill. Keen observers of signs
are these soldier boys and, when they learn that the cars
have come up for the last time, and when they hear, at
dress parade, a letter of praise and patriotic prompting
from General George G. Meade, all this on the 3rd, they
know full well that the days of winterquarters are all but
ended; certainty is added to surety when, at 10 p. m.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
three days' rations are issued with the not over cheerful
information that they must last us six; at midnight, we are
awakened and told to be ready to move in fifteen minutes.
How many glances are cast towards the Rapidan, during
the nearly three hours' wait before the start is made, not
of apprehension but of wonder as to what the outcome
will be when "brave Northmen shall the Southern meet
in bold, defiant manner?" We know full well that our
faces are soon to be set towards the south, that once more
the stream, so often crossed and recrossed, will soon greet
us again as we pass over or through it; remembering the
mettle of the man who is now leading, one who never made
provisions for retreat, because he never retreated, we
realize that in our progress southward there will be no
backward turning, that, while "few shall part where many
meet," some of our numbers will survive to carry forward
the Flag, and everyone had a perfect conviction of the
righteousness of his cause and absolute confidence in its
eventual triumph.</p>

<p class="mb2">The main incidents of these days in early May are writing
themselves deep in the hearts of America; as long as
he lives will every participant, whether in blue or gray,
recall the impressions that were his as he realized the immensity
of the struggle that is impending. Of it, Grant
has said in his Memoirs, "The capture of the Confederate
capital and the army defending it was not to be accomplished
without as desperate fighting as the world has ever
witnessed." Lee left no memoirs but his biographer wrote,
"He divined Grant's plans, and cutting the latter from
the object of his desires, threw himself upon him in a contest
whose fury may be gauged by the fact that the musketry
fire continued in one unbroken roar for seventeen
hours, and trees were shorn down by the musket balls."
The outlines of the movement which began with the start
of the Second Corps, at 11 p. m. of the 3rd, crossing at
Ely's Ford at six o'clock in the morning of the 4th, followed
at Germanna's in turn by that of the Fifth and Sixth Corps

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">May 4, '64</span>

in order, have been told in hundreds of places by both
tongue and pen; they form the a, b, c of 1864 military history,
so we must content ourselves with the fact that when, at
three o'clock of the 4th of May, the Thirty-ninth hears that
ever significant command, "Forward, March!" the Second
Corps, under the lead of Hancock the Superb, is nearing Ely's
Ford in its all night's march; and the ever-vigilant Sixth
Corps, under glorious "Uncle John" Sedgwick, is only awaiting
the advance of our Fifth Corps, led by Warren, around
whose head must ever wreathe the halo of Little Round
Top, before following to take position at our right in the
forthcoming battle-line.</p>

    <h2>THE WILDERNESS</h2>
</div>


<p>At first our own course is northward, toward Culpeper,
then we bear off to the right, passing the headquarters of
the Sixth Corps, and those of the Army of the Potomac
skirting the base of Pony Mountain and on to Germanna,
remembered well in our Mine Run campaign. Though
nominally, for several days a part of the Fifth Corps, we
do not actually meet any part of the Corps itself till just
before reaching the ford. We cross the river at about 11
a. m., nowhere encountering any opposition from the
enemy, who evidently is endeavoring to ascertain what
Grant's objective may be, catching up with the other portions
of the Corps late in the afternoon. After an arduous
march of considerably more than twenty miles, burdened
by heavy knapsacks, filled in winter quarters, our division
bivouaced near the Wilderness Tavern.<a name="FNanchor_J_10" id="FNanchor_J_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_J_10" class="fnanchor">[J]</a> From this
point the almost countless campfires of our army could be
seen, always an impressive sight, and never were the soldiers
of the Potomac Army in a more impressible mood than

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>

after their long period in winter quarters. Of the troop
thus in bivouac, Lieut. Porter of Company A wrote, "The
men were in the best of spirits. They believed that the
supreme effort to bring the rebellion to a close was being
made. There were enthusiasm and determination in the
minds of everyone." A year ago the word "Wilderness"
was frequently heard as the events of Chancellorsville
were discussed and now it is to gain even wider mention;
it seems a name quite out of place in the midst of the Old
Dominion, not so far from the very first settlements in
British North America.</p>

<p>General Morris Schaff in his story of the great battle
says this of the section, "What is known as the Wilderness
begins near Orange Court House on the west and extends
almost to Fredericksburg, twenty-five or thirty miles to
the east. Its northern bounds are the Rapidan and the
Rappahannock and, owing to the winding channels, its
width is somewhat irregular. At Spottsylvania, its extreme
southern limit, it is some ten miles wide." Considerably
more than a hundred years before, there were extensive
iron mines worked in this region under the directions of
Alexander Spottswood, then governor of Virginia. To
feed the furnaces the section was quite denuded of trees
and the irregular growth of subsequent years, upon the
thin soil, of low-limbed and scraggy pines, stiff and bristling
chinkapins, scrub-oaks and hazel bushes gave rise to
the appellation so often applied. Hooker and Chancellorsville
are already involved in memories of the region
and coming days will give equal associations with Grant
and Meade, while the Confederates, remembering that
within its mazes their own shots killed their peerless leader,
Jackson, ere many hours have passed will lament a similar
misfortune to Longstreet.</p>

<p>Within this tangled thicket, artillery will be of no avail
and the vast array of thunderers will stand silent as artillerymen
hear the roar of musketry; cavalry will be equally
out of the question, but within firing distance more than

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">May 4, '64</span>

two hundred thousand men will consume vast quantities
of gunpowder in their efforts to destroy each other. It is
generally understood that General Grant did not expect
an encounter with Lee within the Wilderness itself, as is
evident in Meade's orders to Hancock and the Second
Corps; indeed on the 5th the latter was recalled from
Chancellorsville to the Brock Road at the left of the Fifth
Corps, the Confederates having displayed a disposition
to attack much earlier than the Union Commanders had
thought probable; how Sedgwick and the Sixth Corps held
the Union right, Warren and his Fifth the centre and Hancock
with the Second were at the left are figures from the
past well remembered by participant and student. While
every movement of the Union Army has a southern tendency,
a disposition to get nearer to Richmond, yet in the
Wilderness all of the fighting was along a north and south
line, the enemy exhibiting an unwillingness to be outflanked
as easily as the new leader of the Potomac Army
had evidently expected.</p>

<p>In the morning of the 5th of May, General Richard S.
Ewell commands the Confederate left with "Stonewall"
Jackson's old army or what may be left of it; next to him,
at his right, is A. P. Hill with the divisions of Wilcox,
Heth, Scales and Lane; Longstreet has not arrived as yet,
the morning finding him as far away as Gordonville, but
he is making all the speed possible towards the scene of
conflict, and when he arrives his station will be on the
rebel right, his lieutenants being Anderson, Mahone,
Wofford and Davis. The intricacies of this jungle-infested
region are much better known to the Southern soldiers
than to those from the North, and this knowledge is
a full compensation for any disparity in numbers known
to exist. Burnside and the Ninth Corps of the Federal
forces are just crossing the Rapidan after a forced march
from Rappahannock Station and when they reach the
battle line, it will be to occupy some of the thinly covered
interval between Warren and Hancock. All of the ameni<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>ties
of the long winter months are now forgotten, and war
to the death is confronting every combatant, whether in
blue or gray.</p>

<p>In coming days, these men will recount the events of
May, 1864, and while the roar of musketry will play a
veritable diapason of war for them, they will not forget
how readily they dropped the musket and, grasping axe
or shovel, felled the trees and, weaving them into earth-covered
breastworks, interposed thus much protection
from the cruel missiles of the enemy. If the survivors
of the Potomac Army in the battle summer had chosen
to wear subsequently as under-guards or supports of
their respective Corps-badges, whether, trefoil, Greek
or Maltese Cross or shield, the semblance of musket
and shovel crossed, no one would have questioned its
oppositeness. However averse men may have been to
the regular use of pick and shovel, experience soon told
them that an old fence rail, a small sapling or a shovelful
of earth might ward off a hostile bullet and, lacking
the intrenching tools, they were known to throw up,
in an incredibly brief time, serviceable defenses, using
no more effective utensils than their bayonets, case-knives
and tin plates. Future archaeologists, in the Wilderness
region, will have difficulty in distinguishing between the
works of the Eighteenth century miners and their soldier
successors more than a hundred years later. Deeply
scarred was the battle-riven surface of the Old Dominion
and, centuries hence, poets and historians will wax as
eloquent over some of these fiercely contested places as
did Charles Dickens over the bloody field of Shrewsbury
where "the stream ran red, the trodden earth became a
quagmire and fertile spots marked the places where heaps
of men and horses lay buried indiscriminately, enriching
the ground." Macaulay, too, never wrote with more
brilliant pen than when he described the poppy-strewn
plain of Neerwinden, "fertilized with twenty thousand
corpses."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">May 5, '64</span>

If Grant had known as definitely the mind of Lee as the
latter appeared to divine the intentions of the Union
General, the story of the Wilderness might have been
very different. The orders for the morning of the 5th were
for Warren to move to Parker's store, towards the southwest;
Sedgwick was to follow Warren, ranging up at his
right; Hancock with the Second Corps was to advance,
also towards the southwest, his left to reach to Shady Grove
Church. The enemy was discovered before Warren reached
Parker's store and he was ordered to attack; Getty and the
Second Division of the Sixth Corps were sent to defend
Warren's left flank and Wright with the First Division
of the Sixth Corps was ordered up to Warren's right, and
at nine o'clock Hancock was ordered to come to the support
of Getty, all this happening where Grant had expected,
at least had hoped for, an unopposed passage. Instead
of a retreating enemy, Warren opened the great battle of
the Wilderness by an attack upon a foe ready for the fray;
but let the Fifth Corps Commander tell his own story:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Set out according to orders, 6. a. m., towards Parker's store&mdash;Crawford,
Wadsworth, Robinson; enemy reported close at hand
in force, and when Crawford had nearly reached Parker's,
Generals Meade and Grant arrived and determined to attack
the force on the road near Griffin (Warren's right division).
Wadsworth was gotten into line immediately on the left of Griffin
with one brigade of Crawford, Robinson in support. We attacked
with this force impetuously, carried the enemy's line,
but being flanked by a whole division of the enemy were compelled
to fall back to our first position, leaving two guns on the road
between the lines that had been advanced to take advantage of
the first success. The horses were shot and the guns removed
between our lines. The attack failed because Wright's (Third)
division of the Sixth Corps was unable on account of the woods
to get up on our right flank and meet the division (Johnson's
Ewell's Corps) that had flanked us. Wright became engaged
some time afterward. We lost heavily in this attack, and the
thick woods caused much confusion in our lines. The enemy did
not pursue us in the least. We had encountered the whole of
Ewell's Corps. The enemy that moved on past Parker's along
the Plank Road was Hill's corps. General Getty's division of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
Sixth Corps was sent to the intersection of the Brock Road to
check the column, which it did, and General Hancock was ordered
up from Todd's tavern, and also engaged Hill's corps. At this
time I sent Wadsworth with his division and Baxter's (Second)
Brigade (Second Division) to attack Hill's left flank as he engaged
Hancock. It was late when this was done, but the attack produced
considerable impression. Wadsworth's men slept on their
arms where night overtook them. During the night, I sent instructions
to Wadsworth to form in line northeast and southwest,
and go straight through, and orders were given to attack next
morning at 4.30 with the whole army, Burnside being expected
up by that time to take part. With the rest of my force I prepared
to attack Ewell in conjunction with a part of the Sixth
Corps."</p></div>

<p>During the day, General Alexander Hays, commanding
a brigade in the Second Corps was killed, a contemporary
of Grant at West Point, he was one of the bravest of the
brave; Generals Getty and Carroll were wounded, but
remained on the field. The report of General Robinson,
commanding the division, does not add any essentials to
the report of General Warren. Unfortunately no report
of our Brigade nor of the regiments composing it are found.
Comrade Beck of Company C has this to say of his observations
during the day:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Turned out at three o'clock and started at about light; after
some delay found the rebels in force; the advance forces of our
Corps drove the enemy from his first line of works; we were in reserve
till about 12 m., when we were ordered into line-of-battle on
the right of the Plank Road; dead and wounded are in evidence
and there is hot work ahead. The Rebs have a strong position
across a ravine; our artillery could not be placed in position;
volley after volley was fired all day from all along, both left and
right; we had to lay low, the balls whistled thick around us; at six
o'clock were ordered to charge but were ordered back; it would
have been madness, since the enemy had a cross fire on us. We lay
in line-of-battle all night; many of our wounded could not be
reached, and it was awful to hear their cries; when the stretcher-bearers
tried to get them, the Rebs opened a battery on them."</p></div>

<p>Readers with memories will recall that, some time after
Gettysburg, Longstreet was detached from the Army of

Lee and sent to Georgia to help the Confederates whom
Rosecrans was pressing hard; sometime before this, early
in 1863, two divisions of the Ninth Corps had been withdrawn
from the Potomac and dispatched to the Department
of the Ohio to aid in the campaign Burnside was
then projecting. Both Confederates and Federals had returned
to the East; Longstreet, most remote of the rebel
array, had been striving to reach the field where his chief
was struggling with the Union Army and, by one of the
most wonderful coincidences in all history, Burnside and
his following, save two divisions, were swinging into position
between Warren and Hancock, only a few minutes
later than Longstreet when the latter came up to the
help of Hill. Grant in his Memoirs says that Meade
wished the hour of attack on the 6th to be set at 6 a. m.,
an hour and a half later than the orders of the night of the
5th. "Deferring to his wishes as far as I was willing, the
order was modified and 5 was fixed as the hour to move."
So then we come to the 6th of May and a resumption of
Warren's report:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"At precisely five o'clock the fighting began. General Wadsworth
I re-enforced with Colonel Kitching, 2400 strong (an independent
brigade of the Fourth Division). He fought his way entirely
across the Second Corps' front to the south side of the Plank
Road, and wheeling round commenced driving them up the Plank
Road toward Orange Court House. The accumulating force of
the enemy staggered his advance, and the line became confused
in the dense woods. In the very van of the fight, General Wadsworth
was killed by a bullet through his head, and General
Baxter was wounded. On our right, the enemy was found to be
intrenched and but little impressions could be made. I then sent
another brigade to sustain General Hancock, who had now two
of my divisions and one of the Sixth Corps, and was defending
himself from both Hill and Longstreet. They charged and took
possession of a part of his line but were driven out again. Late
in the evening, the enemy turned General Sedgwick's right very
unexpectedly, and threw most of his line into confusion. I sent
General Crawford at double-quick, and the line was restored to
him.... In most respects, the result of the day's fighting
was a drawn battle."</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>The report of General Robinson of the Second Division
repeats some of Warren's statements, at the same
time mentioning the fact that he accompanied General
Baxter with the Second Brigade, which went with Wadsworth
of the First Division on the 5th, when all hastened
to the relief of Hancock; he names Colonel Lyle, of the
Ninetieth Pennsylvania as commanding the First Brigade.
He also mentions the death of his Assistant Inspector General,
Lieut. Colonel David Allen, Jr., of the Twelfth Massachusetts
on the 5th, and mentions the charge of the First
Brigade (ours) late on the 5th, when the Ninetieth Pennsylvania
suffered so severely. In the afternoon of the 6th, he
was ordered to send another brigade to the support of
Hancock, and later still one more which he accompanied,
ranging them on the right of the Second Corps. There
he ordered the building of rifle-pits, while he rode to Hancock's
headquarters; the latter telling him that he is
ordered to attack, and requesting Robinson to join in the
assault, our Division Commander returned to his command
and made ready to advance, awaiting orders. Two
hours later, heavy firing was heard on his left and he was
visited by General D. B. Birney who stated that the enemy
had broken through our lines and that Hancock was cut
off. Robinson at once faced his second line about and made
ready to receive attacks on his left and rear. Before any
further change was effected, General Birney was summoned
by Hancock, and Robinson learned that, instead
of breaking through, the enemy had been repulsed. It
seems a little strange that the General does not mention
the death of General Wadsworth, his fellow division commander,
nor the wounding of Baxter of his own command.
The taking off of Wadsworth was a great calamity, representing,
as he did, the vast array of citizen soldiery. Far
past the age of military duty, one of the wealthiest men
in the Empire State, he nevertheless threw in his services
and, eventually, his life for the cause he loved.<a name="FNanchor_K_11" id="FNanchor_K_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_K_11" class="fnanchor">[K]</a></p>

Returning to the meager records of our own Regiment, we
glean certain facts, as that the Brigade was advanced in
the morning to nearly its former position and that it was
shortly withdrawn and sent to the extreme left on the
plank-road, where breastworks were thrown up under
active skirmishing. Also on this day, in the various changes
of position, the Fifty-sixth, Fifty-seventh, Fifty-eighth
and Fifty-ninth Massachusetts Regiments were met, all
of them in the Ninth Army Corps, and all of them having
officers largely drawn from the older organizations of the
Bay State. Private Horton of "E" says, "We lay all
night in the same place, the rebels keeping up the firing.
We are relieved at 4 a. m. and go back and get breakfast.
Travel around almost all day; go to the left where
is heavy firing; throw up some rifle-pits." Beck of "C"
in effect coincides with the foregoing, though he closes
the day's account with the words, "Some of the hardest
fighting on record; we build intrenchments on the side of
the road and sleep in them through the night; troops
were passing and repassing all of the evening; we are
having nice warm weather for our operations." Lieutenant
Dusseault of "H" relates the incident of a false alarm,
while the men were lying along the road, between that and
the breastworks:&mdash;"About midnight, while the boys
were trying to get a little sleep, a great racket was heard
not far away, and some in their alarm thought the whole
rebel army was upon us. It proved to be a stampede of
our own cattle, and they came bellowing down the space
between the flanks and the works, and over the prostrate
forms of our men. The choice language of the startled
sleepers, when they came to understand the situation,
added not a little to the tumult." During the day, in
one of the several charges made upon us, "A rebel prisoner,
apparently wounded and just able to crawl about,
on hearing the shouts of his compatriots so near, and

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>

dreading to fall into their hands, much to our amusement,
jumped up a well man and ran like a deer towards our
rear."</p>

<p>Of the charge made in the afternoon of the 5th, this
story is told in the history of the Ninetieth Pennsylvania
whose Colonel, Peter Lyle, was in command of the Brigade,
having succeeded Colonel Leonard of the Thirteenth
Massachusetts:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The command was formed in line-of-battle and advanced until
it reached the open ground, beyond which the enemy was intrenched.
The line was established behind a slight rise of ground
with small trees and bushes in front, the right of the Ninetieth
being separated from the rest of the Brigade which it was impossible
to occupy, being raked by the enemy's artillery. We lay
in this position for some time when General Griffin,<a name="FNanchor_L_12" id="FNanchor_L_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_L_12" class="fnanchor">[L]</a> in command
of the First Division, rode up and commanded a charge. Colonel
Lyle promptly led his regiment forward and, as soon as it had
cleared the shrubbery in front, and emerged upon the open field
rebel batteries opened upon it with grape and canister. The
order was given to double-quick and with a shout it advanced
within close range of the rebel lines. When Colonel Lyle discovered
that he was unsupported, he gave the orders to about-face
and what was left rallied around the colors and, under a
fierce fire of infantry and artillery, returned to its original position....
Out of two hundred and fifty-one men, one hundred and
twenty-four were killed, wounded or captured. From some
misunderstanding or not having received the same peremptory
orders from General Griffin that he gave the Ninetieth the rest
of the brigade did not advance any distance, leaving the Regiment
entirely alone in the charge.</p>

<p>"In fairness to our Regiment, it should be stated that the left
wing heard the orders which sent the Ninetieth forward and, responding,
suffered with it. The wonder is that, in the confusion
of numbers, noise and misunderstood commands, more errors

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
<span class="sidenote smcap">May 6, '64</span>

rather than less, are not recorded. It is not to the discredit of
Colonel Lyle that he is said to have shed tears over the calamity
which befell his brave followers through no fault of his."</p></div>

<p>Colonel Peirson in a paper read before the Loyal Legion
also has a fling at these same guns to the following effect:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"We also left behind two guns which were on the turnpike in
front of Warren's position, which were lost by Griffin on the 5th,
and were between the two armies until we retired. A brigade of
Robinson's division vainly attempted a charge to retake them,
but the plain was swept by canister at 350 yards, and the brigade
returned with heavy loss. It was understood that the sixth Corps
was to join in this attempt but General Upton, whose brigade
lay on the right of Robinson, refused to move, saying, 'It is
madness.' So sensitive were the enemy about the matter, they
fired on our stretcher-bearers, who advanced to bring in the
wounded; and the wounded were not brought in, but lay all
night calling for water and help, to the great distress of their
comrades."</p></div>

<p>Two such days, as were the 5th and 6th of May in the
Wilderness, evidently were as much as even Grant and
Lee could endure. The former is said to have remarked
to Meade on the 7th, "Joe Johnston would have retreated
after two such days' punishment." The losses on both
sides were frightful; there was little of the spectacular
which will always characterize Gettysburg, but men, in
all their mortal combats, never grappled in fiercer, more
determined struggles than in those of the dense and tangled
Wilderness. In his Memoirs, Grant says, "More desperate
fighting has not been witnessed on this continent than
that of the 5th and 6th of May," and he was at Shiloh and
Chattanooga; evidently the great Westerner was changing
his mind as to the fighting qualities of Eastern armies.
The Union force had lost 2,265 killed, 10,220 wounded,
and 2,902 missing; an aggregate of 15,387. While Confederate
data as to numbers are frequently questioned,
the Medical and Surgical History of the War makes the
Southern losses, 2,000 killed, 6,000 wounded and 3,400 missing;
a total of 11,400. The Confederates also had lost
Brigadier Generals Micah Jenkins and John M. Jones,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
both gallant officers, but their greatest personal loss was
that of General Longstreet, grievously wounded on the
6th and immediately carried from the field. Thomas
Nelson Page refers to the event as the fourth similar incident
where, seemingly, the loss of one man ended the hope
of rebel victory, as the deaths of A. S. Johnston at Shiloh,
"Stonewall" Jackson at Chancellorsville, the wounding
of "Joe" Johnston at Seven Pines and of Longstreet,
"at the critical moment when victory hovered over his
arms."</p>

    <h2>THE BATTLE OF THE WILDERNESS</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3"><span class="smcap">By Channing Whittaker</span></p>


<div class="blockquot">

<p>Most of the Infantry fighting of the Wilderness, as is well
known, occurred on May 5th and 6th, 1864, in almost impenetrable
thickets of tangled woodland growth, a growth facilitated
by warmth of climate, by a multitude of streamlets and by areas
of morass. The Infantry line of battle may have been from five
to seven or eight miles in length. General Grant said in his
"Personal Memoirs," written just before his death, "More
desperate fighting has not been witnessed on this continent
than that of the 5th and 6th of May, 1864." The bloodiest
battlefields of those two days were those of Caton's Run of May
5th and of the thicket bordered by the Brock and the Orange
Plank Roads on May 5th and 6th. During the battle I was
pretty completely occupied with what was occurring close about
me and I had little knowledge of what was occurring beyond
my individual eyesight. Since the war I have been too completely
occupied by daily duties to seriously search the records
to ascertain the contribution which the Thirty-ninth Massachusetts
made to the battle as a whole. Since I received your
letter I have tried to ascertain where the Regiment was and what
it did with relation to the battle as a whole on those two days.
It participated in the Battle of Caton's Run on May 5th and in
that of the Brock and Plank Roads on May 6th, but because I
am not at leisure and my sources of information are limited, I
shall attempt no account of either battle as a whole.</p>

<p>It is only recently that I have learned of the trap which the
Confederates had deliberately set for us on the morning of the
5th of May in the gully of the unwooded valley of Caton's Run,
where, ambushed in the woods on the western edge, they awaited

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">May 5, '64</span>

"with fingers on triggers" the initial charge of our brave men,
under the orders of Grant and Meade and Warren, down the
long unwooded slope, across the roughly shaped gully of a primeval
forest stream and up the long and open slope beyond it;
of the brutal and terrible carnage on the slopes and at and about
the battery caught in the gully; and that here, where at about
eight a. m. was killed Charles H. Wilson of Wrentham, Co.
I, Eighteenth Massachusetts, the first Federal infantryman to
fall in the campaign, were controlled and stayed the proud banners
of 17,000 Confederates under Lee and Ewell, including
those of Walker, commanding the famous Stonewall Brigade.
The first assault in this murderous trap was made by Griffin's
First Division of Warren's Fifth Corps, while our Brigade, the
First of Robinson's Second Division of the Fifth Corps, was held
in reserve in their rear.</p>

<p>What I remember of the Battle of the Wilderness after the
lapse of almost fifty years is a story quickly told. Some of the
things which I saw and experienced made an indelible impression
upon my mind. Other events have been crowded out by intervening
occurrences, and of them I have no memory.</p>

<p>I will now state all that I remember of what occurred within
my own experience on the morning of May 5th, 1864. I suppose
these things occurred during Griffin's assault through the
gully, and while the Thirty-ninth was being held in reserve in
Griffin's rear.</p>

<p>We were standing in line of battle in a grove of oaks, the largest
of which were perhaps eight inches in diameter. I was in
the front rank near the right of Company B. First Lieutenant
Spear was in his usual place in the rear of the Company and a
little to my left. Lieutenant Spear turned on his heel and momentarily
vacated his place. Almost instantly a piece of a shell
buried itself where he had stood. Occasional bullets passed over
our heads and among the oaks. Captain W. W. Graham of
Company B was at rest in front of the Company, leaning against
an oak but not behind it. A raw recruit in the rear rank who had
joined the Company at Mitchell's Station and who had not yet
learned to await the word of command aimed his rifle at a venture
and planted a bullet in Captain Graham's oak, close to his
head. Orderly Sergeant Allison shook the recruit by the collar
and threatened terrible things if he should fire again without
orders.</p>

<p>I can not recall that I knew anything of Griffin's assault
while it was in progress, or of the rout which followed it. I have
since learned from General Robinson's report that at the close<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
of Griffin's sanguinary assault, Griffin's Division was relieved
by Robinson's First and Second Brigades, ours, the First, taking
the line of battle.</p>

<p>I remember that the Regiment moved to a new position and
that later in the day we were lying, faces down, on the grass
covered slope of a ridge. Small pines branching from near the
ground broke its surface. Erect, and close behind us, Lieutenant
Colonel Peirson walked back and forth like a sentinel upon his
beat, but with his eyes never off of his ready but prostrate men.
Absolutely alert, in quiet and calm tones, he said to each restless
one who sought a dangerous relief from his unbearable
immobility, "That man in &mdash;&mdash; Company, lie down," or whatever
would cause the man to safeguard himself. The minie
balls continually showered the green pine needles and pitchy
twigs upon us. No one was in such danger as the Lieutenant
Colonel, but he ever walked back and forth, back and forth,
speaking his words of friendly caution. Still later it was desired
that we should lie nearer the top of the ridge. He said to Colonel
Davis, "If you will stand here" (at the right of the line to be
formed) "I will align the men on you." When we again stretched
ourselves upon the slope our heads were close to its top. Later
in the afternoon we were standing in line of battle on the top of
the ridge. The line of battle of a Regiment on our left made an
angle of less than 180 with our own. For a moment I had a
clear, distinct view of its front brilliantly lighted by the rays
of the declining sun. I saw Colonel "Dick" Coulter on his
prancing horse in front of them. The vision though momentary
was changeful, unsteady, as if the men were staggering, falling.
Our Brigade charged down the western slope. A Battery was
in the gully at the foot of the slope, and neither the Federals
nor the Confederates could touch it. The Brigade did not
reach the Battery but returned to the ridge. The cries of the
wounded on the slope were heart breaking. They called for
help, for water. I was told, "General Grant says, 'Let no well
man risk himself for his companion. He will need the help of all
well men to-morrow.'" There was a call for volunteers to act
as skirmishers on the slope toward the battery. I volunteered
without any personal request that I should do so. I was located
some distance down the slope and walked back and forth upon
a "beat," like a camp guard. Then I had a genuine surprise.
While I walked and watched with fear in my heart, the sun
not having yet gone down, Lieutenant Colonel Peirson came
sauntering along the skirmish line as if he was enjoying a pleasurable
stroll. He made some casual remark and, handing me his

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">May 6, '64</span>

field glass, asked if I would enjoy seeking the battery through it.
He left me after I had had abundant time to look, but all of the
fear had gone and did not return. When I next saw the glass
it had been ruined, smashed by a shell which had nearly taken
the life of the Lieutenant Colonel at Spottsylvania. All night I
walked back and forth on the slope.</p>

<p>When we took our position upon the Brock Road, volunteer
skirmishers were again called for and I responded as before. I
was placed perhaps three hundred feet in front of the Regiment
in a typical Wilderness forest tangle. Here were hardwood
trees several inches in diameter, and in an almost impenetrable
mass between them were quickly grown hardwood saplings
of the diameter of one's finger and perhaps twenty feet in height.
These were in the beautiful, tender green, full foliage of May and
often woven all through between their interlacing branches were
strong, green, horse-briar vines in so high and dense a hedge
that had a line of battle been in your front not twenty feet
away you probably could not have seen it. My part was to
watch the thicket in front of my post and to give warning of the
first appearance of the enemy. My fear of the day before did
not return. I had excellent opportunity to hear the rapidly
detonating musketry on my left and front, varied by the deep
bass of occasional artillery. As the firing quickened I could no
longer distinguish intervals between the sounds. I heard only
one clear, loud, inspiring, uplifting, musical sound punctuated
by artillery.</p>

<p>Suddenly, upon my left and behind me all was commotion.
The Sixteenth Maine on our left fired volley after volley toward
the front. My regiment, the Thirty-ninth Massachusetts, followed
their lead. I threw myself upon my face until the fusilade
had ceased. Then I lost no time in reaching the Regiment. I
saw no wounded in our immediate front, but a number in butternut
clothing crawled toward the Sixteenth Maine or lay prostrate
in their front. One in particular, I remember, he was
crawling upon his hands and knees toward the Sixteenth, while
a large, red stream flowed from his throat as I had seen blood
flow from the throat of a slaughtered pig.</p>

<p>I now saw that a wonderful change had occurred in front of
the Thirty-ninth. A wide belt of the forest had disappeared.
Three parallel lines of breastworks, with an abatis in their front,
were undergoing construction along the Brock Road. Men
without axes had felled large trees with hatchets, and saplings
with knives. Bayonets instead of pickaxes had loosened the sun-baked
Virginia clay and tin plates instead of shovels had trans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>ferred
the soil. The trees, the saplings and the clay, under the
direction of skilled mechanics and by the herculean efforts of
determined and rapid workmen, had taken and were taking
effective defensive shape. The moment the firing ceased the
constructive, defensive work again began. I saw upon the
Brock Road a mounted officer, riding and swinging his sword.
I heard him say, "General Grant says, 'If you hold this place
until night, the enemy must evacuate Petersburg and Richmond,
is ours.'" I began to use my bayonet and tin plate with the
rest in constructing breastworks, but the call for skirmishers
soon came again and I went back to watch through the night
and the following day for the first signs of another frontal
attack, which happily did not come. Before we left this place I
listened to the account of my messmate, George V. Shedd, who,
as one of a squad, had passed on duty through a part of the woods
where men wounded, dying and dead had been blistered, blackened
and burned by ruthless forest fires.</p>

<p>I have learned since that on the morning of May 6th a Confederate
engineer officer reported to General Longstreet that
the extreme left of the Infantry of the Army and of the Second
Corps was in the woods in front of the Brock Road and exposed.
A flank attack by four Brigades was immediately made, following
first the unfinished railroad bed where their march was practically
unimpeded and then advancing north through the woods.
Our men, who were cooking coffee, were completely surprised
and routed, and this explains the confusion which prevailed
along the Brock Road when we arrived a little later. The Brock
Road was now almost in the grasp of Longstreet, who hoped to
seize it and to "put the enemy back across the Rapidan before
night." "Longstreet, followed by fresh Brigades at double-quick,"
began to follow up the victory when he and his staff
were mistaken for Federal troops and fired upon by the Sixty-first
Virginia of Mahone's Confederate Brigade. Longstreet
was severely wounded. General Longstreet says, "I immediately
made arrangements to follow up the successes gained and
ordered an advance of all my troops for that purpose."</p>

<p>(Here the hand of our comrade ceased, for fatal illness came
upon him ere his task was ended.&mdash;A. S. R.)</p></div>

<p>One of the saddest features of the Wilderness struggle
was the fire kindled by exploding shells and which raged
unchecked over much of the fighting area, enveloping
in its destroying embrace with equal fury the blue and the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">May 7, '64</span>

gray, whether living or dead, and we can never know how
many among the missing were thus ushered into eternity.
In Northern burial grounds, no unusual sight is that of a
cenotaph or memorial to the memory of a departed
soldier whose body was cremated or burned beyond recognition
in the Wilderness. Save for the industry displayed
in the building of rifle-pits, and the fruitless rebel assault
on the Sixth Corps at our right, the night connecting the
6th and 7th of May was a quiet one; both sides were weary
to the pitch of exhaustion, and both had learned that
breastworks had wonderfully preserving qualities and,
while Sheridan makes something of a stir at our left, as
far away as Todd's Tavern, the day is relatively a peaceful
one. Very likely the respective heads of the two great
armies are taking inventories of their losses and gain, if
any of the latter were observable. Both leaders had suffered
sufficiently in the Wilderness, yet each one is perfectly
willing that the other should attack, and when Grant's
tentative skirmish line fails to draw the men in gray from
their intrenchments, the Union commander knows that
the time for him to continue his march towards Richmond
has come. There appears to be a general agreement among
those keeping diaries that the Thirty-ninth, with the other
regiments of the brigade remained in or near the intrenchments
till well along in the afternoon, when it was withdrawn,
and in the rear had the privilege of preparing something
to eat. Davis, in his story of the Thirteenth Massachusetts,
says fresh meat rations were drawn and cooked
and coffee was boiled, a most grateful relief, if only
a brief one.</p>

<p>Of this day General Warren says that the army took
up defensive positions and spent the time getting together
the several commands which had been detached to defend
parts of the field in the varying emergencies of the previous
days' battles. Of himself he remarks that he had
received, on the 6th, eighteen orders to send reinforcements
to other parts of the line. It is nine o'clock in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
evening of the 7th that the Fifth Corps takes up its line of
march towards the left. Men of other corps are seen asleep
as we pass by, and it is no craven thought for us to wish
that we might slumber also, but "Forward" is the word.
Lieutenant Schaff, more than forty years later to produce
one of the most remarkable battle descriptions ever given,
his story of the Wilderness, an officer on Warren's staff,
says this of the scene:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Here comes the head of Warren's Corps with banners afloat.
What calm serenity, what unquenchable spirit are in the battle-flags!
On they go. Good-by, old fields, deep woods, and lonesome
roads. And murmuring runs, Wilderness, and Caton, you
too farewell. The head of Warren's column has reached the
Brook Road and is turning South. At once the men catch what
it means. Oh, the Old Army of the Potomac is not retreating,
and, in the dusky light, as Grant and Meade pass by, they give
them high, ringing cheers.</p>

<p>"Now we are passing Hancock's lines and never, never shall I
forget the scene. Dimly visible, but almost within reach of our
horses, the gallant men of the Second Corps are resting against
the charred parapets, from which they hurled Field. Here and
there is a weird little fire, groups of mounted officers stand undistinguishable
in the darkness, and up in the towering tree tops
of the thick woods beyond the intrenchments, tongues of yellow
flame are pulsing from dead limbs, lapping the face of night. All,
all is deathly still. We pass on, cross the unfinished railway,
then Poplar Run and then up a shouldered hill. Our horses
are walking slowly. We are in dismal pine woods, the habitation
of thousands of whippoorwills uttering their desolate notes unceasingly.
Now and then a sabre clanks and close behind us
the men are toiling on.</p>

<p>"It is midnight. Tood's Tavern is two or three miles away.
Deep, deep is the silence. Jehovah reigns; Spottsylvania and
Cold Harbor are waiting for us and here The Wilderness ends."</p></div>

    <h2>SPOTTSYLVANIA</h2>
</div>


<p>Of this same day and evening, our own Colonel Peirson
has also given a vivid picture; after quoting Grant's words
to Colonel Theodore Wyman, sitting under a pine tree,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">May 7, '64</span>

on the 7th, "To-night Lee will be retreating south" he
says, in his Loyal Legion paper:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Lee did retreat south, but only for the purpose of intercepting
the onward movement of Grant, and he retreated so rapidly
that we found him at Spottsylvania when we emerged from The
Wilderness. Nightfall of the 7th saw our whole army on the
march for Spottsylvania&mdash;Warren leading with Robinson's
division by the most direct route, which was by the Brock Road,
via Todd's Tavern,&mdash;leaving on the field all our dead and wounded
Grant remarked that if Lee thought he was going to stop to bury
his dead he was mistaken, but a few days later he sent a cavalry
force back with ambulances, who succeeded in saving some of
the wounded men.... The 7th was hot and dusty, and as it was
necessary in order to clear the roads of trains by daylight, the
movement was discovered by the enemy. The Fifth Corps in
the advance, preceded by cavalry and followed by the Second
Corps, took the Brock Road. The Sixth Corps moved by the
Plank and Turnpike roads via Chancellorsville, preceded by the
train, and followed by the Ninth Corps, who were the rear guard....
The Fifth Corps, led by Robinson's division, marched all night
and about six on the morning of the 8th emerged from the wilderness
near Todd's Tavern, and after marching a mile or two came
up with our cavalry, who, as evidenced by several dead cavalrymen
by the roadside, had recently been engaged with the enemy."</p></div>

<p>General F. A. Walker, in his history of the Second Corps,
accounts for the presence of the Confederates at Spottsylvania
on the arrival of the Union army in a very interesting
manner. He says that Lee, convinced of the intention
on Grant's part of moving towards Fredericksburg,
ordered Anderson, who had succeeded to Longstreet's
position, to move in the morning of the 8th to Spottsylvania.
We remember that the whole battle section had
been overrun with fire and that it was still burning when
the orders came. Anxious to escape its unpleasant nearness,
he determined to set out in the evening of the 7th
and so make a night-march of the fifteen miles intervening.
By what Southern pietists might call this Providential
procedure on the part of the Confederate leader, he got
there ahead of Warren.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>Resuming Colonel Peirson's excellent paper bearing
on this campaign, we find him recording as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"As soon as the cavalry got out of the way Robinson's division
at once deployed, with Lyle's brigade on the left and leading, the
Maryland brigade (Third) coming upon his right, and Baxter's
brigade (Second) supporting still further on the right. In this
way they advanced, driving the skirmishers before them by and
beyond Alsop's house, and, reaching a wooded knoll, reformed
the line, which had become somewhat disordered, casting off
their knapsacks in order to move more quickly, and because the
heat made them almost unsupportable. Pushing forward again,
they came in sight of a part of a light battery of the enemy, which
was firing down the Brock Road, and breaking into a run nearly
captured the two guns, driving them well to the rear. The leading
brigade had now advanced some two miles since its deployment,
and had reached a heavily wooded rise of ground, where
they halted for a moment to get breath and some alignment; and
having run much of the distance, had left the rest of the division
far behind. The men were very much blown, and many had
fallen from the way from sunstroke and fatigue. General Warren
here rode up and, saying to General Robinson that his orders
were to go to Spottsylvania Court House, ordered him forward.
Robinson asked for time to get up his other brigades, but after
a few moments of waiting Warren became impatient, and General
Robinson ordered an immediate charge upon the enemy's line,
then in plain sight behind some rude breastworks, saying, 'We
must drive them from there, or they will get some artillery in
position.'</p>

<p>"The enemy's line was formed on a ridge across the Brock Road,
near its junction with a road leading to the Block House, and
was protected by an incomplete breastwork, with small pine-trees
felled for abatis and a rail fence parallel with the line to
the front. The enemy was hard at work finishing their breastworks.
They were two brigades of Kershaw's division of Longstreet's
corps.</p>

<p>"Lyle's brigade, in which my regiment was, charged over 500
yards of open, badly gullied ground under a rapid fire from the
enemy's muskets and from the artillery we had so nearly captured.
The troops went over the rail fence, into the abatis, and
up to within 30 feet of the works, getting shelter then from the
hill and the felled pine trees. Here they lay to recover their
wind, easily keeping down the fire of the enemy in their front,
who fired hurriedly and aimlessly, and while waiting saw the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">May 8, '64</span>

Third Brigade (Marylanders) advancing gallantly across the
field to their support. The latter, however, after getting halfway
to the rebel works, broke under the enemy's fire from the
right and retreated in confusion, General Robinson being shot
in the knee while trying to rally them. The remaining brigade
was too far to the right and rear to assist in this assault. Lyle's
brigade, having rested these few minutes, started to go over the
works, and would have gone over, but at this moment, discovering
a fresh brigade of the enemy advancing in line of battle upon
our left, I (a lieutenant-colonel, upon whom the command had
devolved, so few were the men to reach this spot) reluctantly
gave the order to retire, and the command fell back in some confusion,
but reformed when clear of the flanking fire, and taking
advantage of the accidents of ground checked the advance of
the enemy. The sun was so hot, and the men so exhausted from
the long run as well as from the five days and nights of fighting
and marching, that this retreat, though disorderly, was exceedingly
slow, and we lost heavily in consequence from the enemy's
fire. My own experience was that, while wishing very much to
run, I could only limp along, using my sword as a cane. My color-bearer
(Cottrell) was shot by my side, and unheeding his appeal
to save him, I could only pass the colors to the nearest man, and
leave the brave fellow to die in a rebel prison. The flanking
brigade of the enemy, which so nearly succeeded in surrounding
us, was part of Longstreet's corps (now under command of General
R. H. Anderson) and it was his line we had so nearly broken....
That Longstreet's corps had but just arrived at the line of our
assault is evident from the incomplete nature of the breast
works, and from the fact that they had no artillery in position.
Had there been any support for the brigade which got up to the
rebel works, the enemy's line would have been broken, and our
army would have been between Lee's army and Richmond; but
as we have seen the only supporting brigade was far behind, and
the rest of the Fifth Corps not yet up....</p>

<p>"The delay in Robinson's movement caused by the cavalry
was unfortunate, and gave rise to a good deal of feeling at the
time. General Meade, who was always for giving the infantry
a free foot, had sent orders to General Sheridan, on the night
of the 7th, to have his cavalry out of the Brock Road, but Sheridan,
not receiving them, obstructed the road with a brigade, and
as the cavalry and infantry became unavoidably mixed up, this
delayed the advance.... It is known that in an interview at this
time, General Meade was very indignant with General Sheridan,
until he learned from him personally that he had never received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
the orders to clear the road, when Meade frankly apologized for
what must have been harsh censure. In this interview which
was described to me by Colonel Theodore Lyman, who was
present, General Sheridan, being much chagrined by the censure
of his superior officer, stated there was no force worth speaking
of in front of the advance of the Fifth Corps; but he seems to
have withdrawn this view, when in his cooler moments he came
to write his report. Perhaps the feeling which caused Warren's
unjustifiable removal from the command of the Fifth Corps at
Five Forks began here.... The advanced troops fell back to the
line which had been taken up by the Fifth Corps, intrenched, and
waited for the Sixth Corps to come up, which they did in the
afternoon, going into position on Warren's left. Crawford's
division of the Fifth Corps made an attack in the afternoon, but
with little result beyond capturing some seventy prisoners and
losing considerably in killed and wounded."</p></div>

<p>In the preceding pages General Peirson refers to the
fact of the command of the Regiment devolving on himself;
it might have been stated that Colonel Davis, a
very large and stout man, though doing his best to lead
his men whose pace was more than double-quick, was
completely overcome by the heat and mounted upon one
of the Rebel Battery horses, cut out by Milton F. Roberts
of "C," was carried to the rear. Modesty no doubt influenced
General Peirson not to state that he was, himself,
hit by a portion of a buckshot-cartridge, three of
the missiles lodging in his right arm or shoulder, his sword-cane
giving place to the stalwart shoulders of Isaac H.
Mitchell of "A." Two of the bits of lead were picked out
by the surgeon, the other is there yet. The wound did
not keep the resolute officer long from his post.</p>

<p>Here is the story as told by I. H. Mitchell, Company A,
and transcribed by Channing Whittaker, Company B.:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"It must have been very near to where the Johnnies were that
Lieutenant Colonel Peirson received three buck-shot in his right
arm above the elbow, on May 8th, 1864. It was after we had
been ordered to fall back that I first saw him after he was wounded.
He was conscious, but perfectly helpless. He was trying
to get back. I took him right upon my shoulder and carried him
quite a distance into and part way through the woods, where we

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">May 8, '64</span>

had formed line just before the last charge in which he was
wounded. I had carried him 100 yards sure, and was still carrying
him to the rear, when we met a man with a horse who was
looking for some officer. I told him that I had got to have the
horse to carry the Lieutenant Colonel. He did not object, because
he could not find his man, and the bullets were whistling
about pretty thick at that time. He then led the horse and I held
the Lieutenant Colonel on his back, while I walked by his side.
We followed the general direction of those who were going to the
rear. I was not sure whether we were going in the right direction,
and fearing that we might get into the hands of the Johnnies, I
stopped, took him from the horse and carried him a little distance
from the road into the woods. If I remember rightly, I made
some coffee for him there waiting perhaps two hours, before we
could get a stretcher for him. While we were there General Robinson
was carried by. He had been wounded and he was saying
things. In the meantime they had established a division hospital
in the rear, and I then hailed some stretchers bearers, who took
the Lieutenant Colonel there and I returned to my place in the
Regiment. He came back to the Regiment very soon and was in
our next fight."</p></div>

<p>As the day advanced the other corps came into their
respective positions, the Second being massed at Todd's
Tavern, protecting the rear of the army and the Ninth
was at the extreme Union left, and there was more or less
fighting along the whole line at some time in the day.
A melancholy train was that made up of ambulances
and baggage wagons which on the 8th set out for Fredericksburg,
bearing 12,000 wounded men, thence via Belle
Plain Landing and the Potomac to be distributed to the
great hospitals of Washington and points further North.
Sheridan and his troopers also received orders to set out
upon their famous raid which would flank Lee's army,
reach the outer defenses of Richmond, slay J. E. B. Stuart,
the most remarkable cavalryman of the Confederacy,
and leave a gruesome token of its venturesome trip by a
trail of decaying horseflesh and freshly made graves for
considerably more than a hundred and fifty miles. The
magnitude of this adventure, which began Monday morning,
May 9th, may be seen when we know that it com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>prised
10,000 horsemen, riding in fours and well closed
up, yet constituting a column thirteen miles long requiring,
according to a rebel authority, four hours at a brisk
pace to pass a given point; what an eye opener such a
force must have been to the Confederates at home, who
had little notion of the resources of the North. Rejoining
the Federal army at Chesterfield Station, on the 25th,
its results were summed up in having deprived Lee's forces
of their "Eyes and Ears" (cavalry) since all of the mounted
rebels started in pursuit, as soon as the move was understood;
it had damaged Lee's communications, liberated
nearly four hundred Union prisoners, destroyed an immense
quantity of supplies, killed the leader of his cavalry,
saved the Union Government the subsistence of ten
thousand horses and men for more than two weeks, perfected
the morale of the cavalry corps and produced a
moral effect of incalculable good to the Union cause.</p>

<p>Returning to the incident of the artillery referred to by
Colonel Peirson in his paper, it is interesting to find the
same affair recounted by one of the leading Confederates,
General Fitzhugh Lee, in one of his war sketches. After
alluding to the ubiquity of the cavalry and the work it
had done in preparing the way for the arrival of R. H.
Anderson's (Longstreet's) Corps, he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Major James Breathed, commanding my horse artillery,
remained behind and by my order placed a single gun in position
on a little knoll. We knew the enemy's infantry was marching
in column through a piece of woods, and the object was to fire
upon the head of the column, as it debouched, to give the idea
that a further advance would again be contested, and to compel
them to develop a line of battle with skirmishers thrown out, etc.
The delay which it was hoped to occasion by such demonstration
was desirable. Under Major Breathed's personal superintendence
shells were thrown, and burst exactly in the head of the column as
it debouched. The desired effect was obtained; the leading troops
were scattered, and it was only with some difficulty a line of
battle with skirmishers in its front was formed to continue the
advance. I was sitting on my horse near Breathed, and directed
him to withdraw his gun, but he was so much elated with his

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">May 8, '64</span>

success that he begged to be allowed to give the enemy some
more rounds. He fired until their line got so close that you could
hear them calling out: 'Surrender that gun, you rebel scoundrel.'
Breathed's own horse had just been shot. The cannoneers
jumped on their horses, expecting of course the gun to be captured,
and retreated rapidly down the hill. Breathed was left
alone. He limbered up the gun and jumped on the lead horse.
It was shot from under him. Quick as lightning he drew his
knife, cut the leaders out of the harness and sprang upon a swing
or middle horse. It was also shot under him just as he was turning
to get into the road. He then severed the harness of the
swing horses, jumped upon one of the wheel horses, and again
made a desperate attempt to save his gun. The ground was
open between the piece and woods; the enemy had a full view of
the exploit; and Breathed at last dashed off unharmed, miraculously
escaping through a shower of bullets."</p></div>

<p>In confirmation of the foregoing, is the statement of
Sergt. Wm. A. Mentzer, Company A, as follows: "After
advancing about two and one-half miles we came to a piece
of artillery on a knoll. While the Rebs fired at us, to our pleasure
as well as surprise, they fired over our heads. We drove
them from their position about half-a-mile, when they
opened on us again. We in the front rank gave them a
Yankee yell and charged for the gun. We shot one horse
and drove away all the men but one, who dismounted,
cut the traces of the dead horse, remounted in a hurry and
got away with the gun just as we thought it was ours."</p>

<p>Battle scenes and incidents, we think, are indelibly
impressed upon the memory. Sometimes they are; more
often many of the prominent features disappear entirely,
so that when the locality is revisited, difficulty is found in
reconciling the past impressions with those of the present.
Thus many of the Thirty-ninth who made that exhausting
charge under fire, in the morning of the 8th of May, would
find themselves at fault at many points, and would wonder
at the changes in the face of nature, had they the opportunity
to go over the route followed under such adverse
circumstances. Channing Whittaker of "B," however,
is sure he could recognize the spot where the Regiment re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>formed
and momentarily rested; the place where Colonel
Peirson and General Robinson were wounded; the road
cut through the hill which Grant's army did not pass over
on May 8th or 9th, the hillside on which he was wounded
and where he spent the night after the fight; the point
whence he saw three mounted Confederate Generals and
where he saw Sergt. Major Conn, hacking away with his
short Sergeant Major sword at a multitude of Confederates
who had set upon him and finally carried him away
captive and, above all, just where Breathed's rebel battery
was dislodged.</p>

<p>Of the exactions of this day, M. H. Mentzer, "A," says,
"Many were exhausted but an officer begged us to cross
over one field more. We had been advancing and under
fire from early morning, but we started again, a very thin
blue line, through a valley, up a rise, when a terrible hail
of bullets met us; we lay down and hugged the dirt; a
lull, and then distinctly from the enemy came the order,
"Now rally &mdash;&mdash; North Carolina and give them H&mdash;ll!"
Over they came, taking many prisoners from our little
line. I started to run as others did but tripped and fell
headlong down the hill lying still until they had pushed
our boys well back, when I crawled a short distance to
cover, several shells bursting in my path as I got away.
Out of the way, covered with sweat, dirt and ashes, for
the cinders of the Wilderness were yet on us, I fell asleep,
and remained here till about four o'clock in the afternoon.
I fell in with a Natick boy, Company I, who had a bullet
hole in his wrist; I washed out the wound, tore a piece
from my shirt and bandaged it as well as I could, washed his
face and hands, made some coffee to cheer him up and
then took him to a hospital on the field. Then I set out to
find my Brigade and Regiment and found them at twilight;
my brother, Sergt. Mentzer, had reported me as dead
with a bullet-hole through my forehead; those who saw
me trip and plunge forward must have mixed me up with
someone that looked like me. It was in the work of this

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">May 8, '64</span>

forenoon that General Robinson was wounded and Jeff.
Cottrell, of "A," Color Sergeant, was wounded and was
carried part way off the field by Charles Goodwin, only
to die at last in a rebel prison. My brother, Sergt. W. A.
Mentzer, then took the colors and carried them until
Major Tremlett reorganized the color-guard."</p>

<p>J. H. Burnham also of "A," recalls, "The march down
the Brock Road with the Fifth Corps from the Wilderness,
the night of the 7th of May, and our running into Longstreet's
corps, then under General Anderson. The rebels
were behind, hastily erected breast works and were ready
for us. We advanced across an open field and suffered
much from the rifle fire. When near the works, I was
hit in the abdomen. Throwing down my gun, I made my
way back across the field, over the dead and dying, and
lay down under a tree in front of a house. As this was
early in the morning of the 8th, I don't think there were
many other wounded men there then, but later others
came. Sometime in the forenoon, a lady came out of the
house and asked me if I was badly hurt. She also said
that she was from New Jersey. It seems as though she
said the place was the Laurel Hill farm, though I understand
it is known in history as the Alsop farm. The next
day came the ambulances, tents and other outfit of the
Fifth Corps. I should like to go there some day and have
a look at the place where I expected to give up my life.
I carried the ball in my body for months and have it now.
I never rejoined the Regiment."</p>

<p>We owe much to Colonel Peirson's recollections of the
service of the Regiment, but in this affair at Alsop's he
fails to recount a story remembered by McDonald of "B,"
who says that in the company was a tall Scotchman,
Hunter by name, much inclined to stoop and, for this
reason was frequently enjoined by the critical Lieut.
Colonel to take "the position of a soldier." In the advance
of this trying Sunday, Robert was stooping as usual
when a bullet went through his cap. When the ball was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
over and the opportunity came, Hunter sought the
officer and, holding up his headgear, remarked, "Now,
look at that; if I had ta'en the position of a so'ger, be
G-d, that ball wud a gone thru' my heed." R. W. Hall
of "F" recites an interesting experience of this 8th of May,
"I had penetrated the abatis in front of the Rebs and was
unable to extricate myself in time, when our boys fell
back, and with about one hundred and fifty others was
taken prisoner, but I never saw the inside of a rebel prison,
as Sheridan in his great raid overtook us toward
evening of the following day at Beaver Dam Station on
the Virginia Central Railroad, where we were waiting.
How plainly I can see General Custer and another cavalryman
in the lead, when they dashed down the road as we
were about to take the train for Richmond. Of course
we had to keep up with the cavalry during the raid
and to dodge the Rebs who, in small squads, contested
the way. Their General Stuart was killed or mortally
wounded, May 11th, at the Yellow Tavern, in a very hot
fight. After several days' rapid marching, we came out
at Malvern Hill, on the James. The gunboats took us
for Rebs and gave us several shots. City Point, on the
other side of the river, was not so very far away and thence
we ex-prisoners took a transport for Alexandria, where
we were re-equipped and sent to the front as guard for a
supply-train of the Ninth Corps. When Nelson and I
reported for duty the surprise we gave our comrades may
be imagined."</p>

<p>The 8th was a bloody day for the Thirty-ninth, the
summary of losses revealing ninety-three killed, wounded
and missing. Lieutenant Dusseault was wounded in the
breast but an army button diverted the bullet. As he
wrote in his diary, "I was within thirty feet of the enemy's
works, and when I was hit, I was sure I was killed, as the
force of the blow caused me to spin round and round like
a top, and I fell to the ground. Finding I was not seriously
hurt, I jumped up and joined in the retreat. When we

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">May 8, '64</span>

got back, we found Captain W. C. Kinsley of Company
K in tears; 'Look at my company!' he cried, 'Only seven
men left out of eighty-seven!' But he was assured that
the woods were full of our men and that his would be in
shortly. It proved to be so. We were not called on for
the rest of the day, and that night we obtained some
sleep."</p>

<p>During the closing hours of the 8th, there was digging
for the Fifth Corps and the early hours of the 9th found
the hard worked soldiers still using the shovel; the night
and the following day showing no less than three distinct
efforts in this direction for the Thirty-ninth, a record in
which the stories of the Sixteenth Maine and Thirteenth
Massachusetts accord. Of the day itself and the new positions
of the several corps, Colonel Peirson remarks, "The
9th was another hot and dusty day, and the Fifth and
Sixth Corps occupied it in pressing the enemy and developing
his position, seeking points of assault. The enemy
were still passing down during the morning the Parker's
Store Road, in dangerous proximity to our right and rear,
and Hancock's Second Corps was at 10 a. m. moved into
position on Warren's right, making lines of battle along
the crest commanding the valley of the Po, the artillery
shelling the rebel trains which were in sight, causing them
to take a more sheltered road." The new position of the
opposing forces might be stated, briefly: from the northwest
to the southeast, a distance of two miles, were Hancock
and his Second Corps at the right, next to Warren
and the Fifth; then Sedgwick with the Sixth; and at the
extreme Union left, Burnside and the Ninth Corps. At
the rebel right was Hill's Corps, now under Early; the
extreme left was held by Longstreet's men, under Anderson;
and the intermediate distance, including the famous
Salient, was occupied by Ewell's Corps.</p>

<p>The event of the 9th which emphasized it in the annals
of the campaign was the death of Sedgwick, Commander
of the Sixth Corps. Since the fall of Reynolds at Gettys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>burg,
no similar misfortune had befallen the army of
equal importance; universally respected, all but idolized
by his own men, his very presence at any time was worth
whole brigades to the cause he loved. "While standing
behind an outer line of works, personally superintending
and directing, as was his custom, the posting of a battery
of artillery at an angle which he regarded of great importance,
he was shot through the head by a rebel sharpshooter,
and died instantly. Never had such a gloom
rested upon the whole army on account of the death of
one man as came over it when the heavy tidings passed
along the lines that General Sedgwick was killed." He
was Connecticut born, West Point, 1837, having as classmates,
Hooker, E. D. Townsend, and Wm. H. French,
late Commander of the Third Corps, all of the Union Army;
while his rebel fellows included Braxton Bragg, Pemberton
of Vicksburg fame, and one might wonder whether
Jubal Early, over at the rebel right, had a twinge of sadness
over the summary taking off of the man who, in earlier
times, had stood by his side on the West Point parade
ground. Born in 1813, Sedgwick was not yet fifty-one
years old when sought by the enemy's bullet.</p>

<p>Some of the besetments of army life and duty at this time
are well set forth in the story that Lieutenant Dusseault,
of Company H, tells of his efforts to replenish the supply
of ammunition for the brigade: "That same night&mdash;and
it was a dark one too&mdash;I was detailed to go back to the
ordnance train for ammunition. I had sixty men from
the five different regiments of our Brigade to help me. I
was ordered to bring 25,000 rounds (twenty-five boxes).
We had secured the requisite amount and were returning
to the brigade in the thick darkness. As it took two men
to carry a box, which was supported on a blanket between
them, it was impossible to keep the men together, and as
I did not know them, many of them dropped their burdens
and ran away. When we got back to our camping place,
we found that the brigade had moved on a mile and a half

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">May 9, '64</span>

further. When I came to my superior officer, I had but
seven boxes to deliver to him. Rousing from his sleep,
he ordered me to go back immediately and secure the rest,
and then turned over and went to sleep again. It had to
be done and at about two or three o'clock in the morning I
reported the second time, not with the lost boxes, but
with enough others that had been obtained in a way which
I will not stop to explain."</p>

<p>May 10th adds another day to the long battle list of
1864; while a part of the Spottsylvania encounter, it
bears to those who had a part, the sub-title of "Laurel
Hill," the location being in the same vicinity as that of
Sunday's fight at Alsop's Farm, possibly somewhat
further towards the south. While there was fighting along
the entire line, of that portion of the same in which we
are directly interested, Swinton, in his history of the Army
of the Potomac, says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The point against which the attack was designed to be made
was a hill held by the enemy in front of Warren's line. This was
perhaps the most formidable point along the enemy's whole
front. Its densely wooded crest was crowned by earthworks,
while the approach, which was swept by artillery and musketry
fire, was rendered more difficult and hazardous by a heavy growth
of low cedars, mostly dead, the long bayonet-like branches of
which, interlaced and pointing in all directions, presented an
almost impassable barrier to the advance of a line of battle.
The attack of this position had already been essayed during the
day by troops of the Second and Fifth Corps, and with most unpromising
results. When Hancock's divisions joined the Fifth,
an assault was made by the troops of both corps at five o'clock;
but it met a bloody repulse. The men struggled bravely against
an impossible task, and even entered the enemy's breastworks at
one or two points; but they soon wavered and fell back in confusion
and great slaughter. Notwithstanding the disastrous
upshot of this assault, the experience of which had taught the
troops that the work assigned them was really hopeless, a second
assault was ordered, an hour after the failure of the first. The
repulse of this was even more complete than that of the former
effort. The loss in the two attacks was between five and six
thousand, while it is doubtful whether the enemy lost as many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
hundreds. Among the killed was Brigadier General Rice<a name="FNanchor_M_13" id="FNanchor_M_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_M_13" class="fnanchor">[M]</a> of
the Fifth Corps, distinguished for his intrepid bearing on many
fields."</p></div>

<p>This was the day, when at the left of the Fifth Corps
a portion of the Sixth was more successful, yet even its
fruits were not held. General Emory Upton of the First
Division, Second Brigade, in a vigorous charge carried
the enemy's first line of intrenchments, capturing nine
hundred prisoners and several guns. This attack, however,
was unsupported and the advantage could not be maintained,
so that at nightfall Upton withdrew and the
captured guns were left behind. General Meade ascribed
the failure of the movement to the lack of expected support
from Mott's Division of the Second Corps on his left.
The reports of Generals Meade and Warren add nothing
to the foregoing while Lieutenant Colonel Peirson particularizes
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The ground in front of the Laurel Hill position was swept by
the enemy's artillery, and our men suffered severely from it. In
our own Regiment, we lost several men, killed by the falling limbs
of the huge pine trees cut off by the enemy's artillery fire. One
of our men was pinned to the ground by one of these limbs, so
near to the enemy's line, that, when we retreated, as we did upon
receiving a terrific musketry fire at point blank range, he was the
only one who saw that after the volley the enemy ran as fast as
we did, but in the opposite direction. They soon returned, however,
and captured the observer. At some points our troops even
entered the breastworks, but the men though brave were easily
discouraged, and the long continued strain and fatigue told upon
their spirit; and while they would defend their position to the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">May 10, '64</span>

last, or retire in the face of heavy odds with the utmost coolness,
the fact remains that the men of the Second and Fifth Corps
were not as ambitious on the 10th, as they had been on the 6th
and 8th of May."</p></div>

<p>While the Ninth Corps, General Burnside, did no severe
fighting on the 10th, the day nevertheless was significant
in Bay State records through the death of General Thomas
G. Stevenson, commanding the First Division of that
Corps. Born in Boston, February 3, 1836, he early displayed
a bent for military matters and at the outbreak of
the Rebellion commanded a battalion of militia in Boston
harbor. At the head of the Twenty-fourth Massachusetts
Infantry, he accompanied the Burnside Expedition to
North Carolina, winning laurels everywhere. On the
return of Burnside from the Southwest, Stevenson who
already had won his star, was made commander as above
and like Rice and Sedgwick is supposed to have been the
victim of a sharpshooter.</p>

<p>While Colonel Peirson has given us a deal of information
concerning the beginning of the Battle Summer, he
says nothing of the fact that he had, himself, a narrow escape
from death. Colonel Theodore Lyman, in his diary,
writes of a visit made by himself and General Peirson to
these scenes, and has this to offer on his observations:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"A few hundred yards to the right of where this attack was
made, we visited the patch of pine woods, where, on the 10th,
Peirson's brigade again advanced to the attack. The brigade
advanced to within about one hundred yards of the works, and
then began firing in the thick woods, being exposed to a tremendous
artillery enfilade, whose marks still remained in the
fallen timber. Peirson said he ordered his men to cease firing,
finding few balls coming the other way, but got an order from the
brigade commander to open again. Then Peirson was knocked
senseless by a shell."</p></div>

<p>Concerning the injury to Colonel Peirson, Lieut.
Dusseault of "H" has this version:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"On the 10th of May at Laurel Hill, our men were lying flat
upon the ground, under the enfilading fire of artillery from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
left and the direct fire of musketry from the front. As an officer
of Company H, I had been trying to get up into the line a private
of that company who was lying forty or fifty yards behind it.
I had tired of exposing myself in the endeavor and had left
him and taken my place in the line. At about that time, Lieutenant
Colonel Peirson, who was walking back and forth, erect, as
was his custom, saw him and went back to get him up into his
place. I went back to help him. We had succeeded in getting
him up to within eight or ten feet of the line. The Lieutenant
Colonel who was within two feet of me, had his sword in his
hand, both arms extended, and was leaning forward a little,
when a piece of a shell came between his arms and his body,
ripped out the breast of his coat, smashed his field glasses in their
case, and jammed the hilt of his sword. He doubled up, fell
forward on his head, and then over sideways. Colonel Davis,
who was standing eight or ten feet in our rear, asked, 'Lieutenant,
is he dead?' and I answered, 'Yes.' I called two men of my
company and told them to take him to the rear. They turned
him over upon his back, one taking hold of him near the head,
and the other by the feet. When they commenced to raise him,
his eyes began to blink and he answered the question which had
been asked three or four minutes earlier by Colonel Davis, saying,
'No. I guess it isn't much.' He was sent back to the hospital
and was very sick there, but he rejoined the Regiment on the 9th
of June. Lieutenant Colonel Peirson was strictly a temperance
man, but he carried a flask of brandy for emergencies, and he had
requested some of the officers to give some to him if he should
be hurt. It happened that the shell cut off the lower half of the
flask and it fell in front of Private Richardson of Company A.
A few drops remained in the flask which Richardson immediately
drained, saying, 'They are throwing good brandy at us.'"</p></div>

<p>Of this same event, one of the men of "A" writes, "One
piece of shell wounded Colonel Peirson, ripping off a row
of buttons from his coat. I picked them up and divided
them with the boys. I have one left now. Salem Richardson
got the bottom of the Colonel's brandy flask, which
was shot away by the same bit of shell, and I wish you
could have seen him empty it." The same incident is
called up by S. H. Mitchell, also of Company A, whose
members evidently were keeping their commander under
observation. The flask was carried against an emergency,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">May 10, '64</span>

when it might be of great utility. It offered no resistance
whatever to the Confederate missile but Comrade Richardson
always averred that the coming of the drink was most
opportune. From the story of the Sixteenth Maine, it is
learned that this day the brigade was temporarily assigned
to the First Division, General Cutler commanding. The
Second brigade was placed in the Third Division, under
Crawford, and the Third was made independent to report
directly to General Warren, these changes being induced,
supposedly, on account of the heavy losses and the wounding
of the commanding officer, General Robinson.</p>

<p>Possibly the doings of the 11th can be described no better
than by copying the record as made at the time by John S.
Beck, "Rested all day to-day, if you can call it rest, for we
were in a mudhole, out of the range of Rebel shells. Our
brigade looks small; drew rations; raining hard, everything
wet through, no blankets or shelter tents. I should have
been sick were it not for the excitement of battle. Our
position here looks dubious, as we have to fight the enemy
behind concealed breastworks and in dense woods. To-night
we lay down on the wet ground with an old, wet,
woolen blanket which I picked up." Considering that this
rain was the first since crossing the Rapidan, it really was a
comfort even if it did make some, for the time, unpleasantly
wet. The 11th is noteworthy from another fact, viz., that
it is on this day that Grant telegraphs to Washington the
prominent features of the campaign thus far, that reinforcements
would be encouraging, and that he purposes
"to fight it out on this line, if it takes all summer."</p>

<p>Thursday, the 12th of May, is the day of the dread
"Salient" or the "Bloody Angle" of Spottsylvania. Had
our Regiment been with Barlow's men of the Second Corps,
or with the Vermont Brigade of the Sixth, the mortality
record of the Thirty-ninth might have been far different,
though all participants in any portion of this bloody field
have ever thought their losses severe enough. The vision
of that First Division of the Second Corps, in the morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
mists emerging from the woods at the Union left centre,
and with determined rush, "a narrow front, but extending
back as far as the eye could see," seeking the Confederate
works, is one that memory needs no assistance in recalling.
Through wonderful good fortune for us, the artillery of the
enemy had been withdrawn and the guns which might have
cut wide swaths through that disordered mass of blue,
were hastening back, arriving just in time to be captured,
the assault resulting in the capture of General Edward
Johnson's Division of Ewell's Corps, including the commander,
with twenty pieces of artillery and thirty stands
of colors. But this did not end the day. So furious was
the foe over the loss of men, munitions and position, that
the struggle for reinstatement became possibly the fiercest
and most deadly of the entire war. Once at least, the bayonet
became a weapon of real contact. Here it was that the
large oak tree was actually cut down by bullets from both
sides. The ground, at the margin of the works, was covered
with piles of the dead, and for twenty hours the battle
raged, until the wearied rebels withdrew, unable to retake
the lines lost in the morning.</p>

<p>In this rapid survey, no mention is made of the Sixth
and Ninth Corps, but each one accomplished the task
assigned, nor was the Fifth by any means idle. Inferring
from the forces pressing upon Hancock in his endeavor to
hold advantage of the early morning, that the enemy must
be withdrawing his right and left to assist his centre, both
Burnside and Warren were ordered forward. Warren
obeying, advanced at something after nine o'clock, but was
repulsed, "for Longstreet's corps was holding its intrenchments
in force." Of this in his report, Warren says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The enemy's direct and flank fire was too destructive. Lost
very heavily. The enemy continuing to fire on the Second and
Sixth Corps, I was compelled to withdraw Griffin's and Cutler's
divisions (First and Fourth) and send them to the support where
they again became engaged. My whole front was held by Crawford's
Division (Third) and Kitching's and the Maryland Brigades,
presenting a line of battle not as strong as a single line. The

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">May 12, '64</span>

enemy made no serious attempt to force it. My divisions on the
left were relieved during the night from their position, and returned
to the right in the morning, having been kept awake
nearly all the night, which was rainy."</p></div>

<p>A graphic picture of the work of the Brigade is painted
by Adjutant Small of the Sixteenth Maine in his history of
the Regiment, and a portion of it is reproduced here:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The men, thoroughly exhausted, would lie at length on the
cool, fresh earth, some of the timid ones hugging the bottom of
the trench, painfully expressing the dread of something to come.
And yet these timid ones, at the first rebel yell, would over and
'at them,' or draw bead on some venturesome Johnnie, and
shout with derision if he was made to dodge. If they dropped
him, a grim look of satisfaction, shaded with pity, passed over
their dirty faces. The quiet was almost unbearable, the heat in
the trenches intolerable, and rain, which commenced falling, was
most welcome. Time dragged. We had not the slightest hint
of what was developing. The rebels seemed very far off and
trouble ominously near. From the right came an aide, and,
quietly passing down the line of works, he dropped a word to this
and that colonel; only a ripple, and all was again suspiciously
still. 'What was it, Colonel?' asked the adjutant. The Colonel
made no reply but simply pointed up the hill. Soon he took out
his watch and looked anxiously to the right. Suddenly a commotion
ran down the line, followed by the command, 'Attention!
Forward, double quick!' On went the Brigade with a yell which
was echoed by thousands of throats in front and was thrown
back by the double columns in our rear. Down from the rebel
right thundered shot and shell, making great gaps in our ranks,
while on swept the Brigade, until suddenly loomed up in our
front, three lines of works&mdash;literally a tier, one above another,&mdash;bristling
with rifles ready aimed for our reception. There was
lead enough to still every heart that was present, and yet, when
sheets of flame shot out in our faces, scarcely a dozen of the Regiment
were hit. Then men tore wildly at the abatis, and rushed
on only to fall back or die. Again and again did the Brigade
charge, and as often came those terrible sheets of flame in our
faces, while solid shot and shell enfiladed our ranks. The crash
which followed the fearful blaze swept away men, as the coming
wind would sweep away the leaves from the laurel overhead....
Just as the last charge of ammunition was rammed home, relief
came, when the Brigade retired to the works in the rear, to learn
that it was not expected of the Brigade to carry the works, only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
to hold a strong force of the enemy, while Hancock carried the
lines in his front, which were more favorably situated for a successful
attack."</p></div>

<p>It was in the trying scenes of this exacting effort that
Major Leavitt, of the Sixteenth, so endeared by his manly
character, received the wound from which he died on the
30th instant in Washington. His was a nature too broad
and brave to be confined to the limits of his own Regiment.
"None knew him but to love him."</p>

<p>How the day seemed to a Company C man appears in
his diary entry for the day: "Still damp, wet and rainy;
the day opened with an advance of the Second Corps under
Hancock, who carried the enemy's front line of breastworks
and captured a division of the rebels and their General,
Johnson. We were soon on the move to support our First
Division in a general charge and were soon into it, hot and
heavy. The enemy soon had another enfilading fire of
grape and canister on us, and we could do nothing. Edward
Ireland was killed by a solid shot and Henry Ireland was
wounded in the arm. Soon after being withdrawn to the
rear, we were sent to the left to support the Sixth Corps,
and lay in a line of rifle-pits about two hours, when again
we advanced through the woods and joined the Sixth Corps
on the right, where we lay all the afternoon. We heard our
folks pouring shells into the enemy from mortars. We
turned in for the night, resting on our arms, wet through
to the skin."</p>

<p>The night was uncomfortable enough and during its
hours there was an alarm that the enemy was advancing,
while the truth was that Johnny Reb was quite as tired as
the Yankees. Even soldiers must rest sometime, and early
in the morning of the 13th the division was withdrawn to
the rear, and for a short time laid aside responsibility, but
it was not a long rest, since those rifle-pits must be filled
with someone, and all too soon "we were moved up to the
right, into works along with the One Hundred and Forty-sixth
New York. Nothing here but water and mud.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">May 13, '64</span>

Showery all day, though the men are in good spirits, notwithstanding.
About 8 p. m. when we were beginning to
arrange to stretch out for the night, orders came to move,
and we fell in, following the rest of the corps to the left.
The mud was dreadful, the night dark, we forded streams
up to our knees, and the mud all the time was over shoes."
Grant had not yet found the spot through which he could
force his way, so the Fifth Corps once more essays the part
of pioneers, and leads the move towards the inevitable
left, seeking in vain for some point not bristling with rebel
bayonets, or threatening with black throated cannon.
Truly our Lieutenant General is finding out, not only how
strenuous is the Eastern Union soldier, but his eyes are
opening wide as to the resourcefulness of the Eastern Confederate
and his eternal vigilance.</p>

<p>It is another flank movement, and the men of Warren's
Corps are moving to Burnside's left with orders to assault
with that Corps at four o'clock in the morning of the 14th.
Very likely the difficulties of this night, with its more than
Egyptian darkness, had not been reckoned upon by the
Commander and the appointed hour found the would-be
assailants a long way from the point of expected advance.
The route was past the Landrum House to the Ny River,
which had to be waded, and beyond the route did not
follow any road, traversing the fields, and a track was
cut through the woods. Then came a fog, so dense that
not even the fires built to light the way could be seen.
Men exhausted by the difficulties of the move and previous
exactions fell asleep all along the way. The new locality
was quite unknown and by daylight when the expected
attack was to take place, only Griffin with his First Division,
having only twelve hundred "fagged-out men" had
arrived. It was seven o'clock before General Cutler got
thirteen hundred of his men together. Naturally the
four o'clock charge was not made.</p>

<p>Wright and the Sixth Corps moved still further to the
left, but had to do some fighting to get just the position<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
wanted. All observers, whether of Regiment or Brigade,
agree that the day was wet and comparatively quiet,
though the enemy's shells passed harmlessly over the heads
of the tired men, many of whom slept the sleep of utter
exhaustion, the waking ones thankful that the fuses in
said shells were long enough to keep up their hissing until
a considerable distance beyond us before bursting. In
the mutations of fighting and moving about, all the regular
contents of knapsacks had disappeared, the most of
the men retaining, in addition to canteen and haversack,
rubber blankets only; besides, rations were scarce, yet
men were content to rest without food, so trying had been
the ordeal of the preceding ten days. After all, the average
Yankee is ever anxious to know just where he is, and
several entries of the 14th are to the effect that the Regiment
is near the Fredericksburg turnpike, about eight
miles from the city itself and, from a mile and a half to
two miles from Spottsylvania Court House. With only
the canopy of the sky as a covering, a large part of the
Thirty-ninth slept through the night of the 14th-15th.</p>

<p>The 15th is Sunday, and just a week away from the
sad experience of Alsop's farm. These men of the First
Brigade are fast becoming hardened veterans, and they
have the privilege of greeting as such the comrades who
had been home on re-enlistment furloughs and who, this
day, got back again. There are many comparisons between
the spic-and-span attire of the just-returned, and the
"of-the-earth, earthy" apparel of men who, for ten long
days and nights have fought and marched, at intervals
hugging muddy mother-earth, till all semblance of cleanliness
has disappeared, and dress parades have faded out
of the recollections of all concerned. Then too the ravages
of the hotly contested field have torn great gaps in the
erstwhile well-filled ranks so that only squads of men constitute
what have been long company lines. Some boys
remark on the quiet of Sunday and think it properly kept;
three days' rations are drawn, including fresh beef, and,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">May 15, '64</span>

with returning vitality and spirits, learning that the
Eleventh Massachusetts Battery, in the Ninth Corps, is
hard by, men of the Thirty-ninth make friendly visits to
their acquaintances therein. Colonel Davis comes back
to the Regiment to-day, looking much better than when
he dropped out. Towards night, six o'clock, the troops are
formed in line with expectation of an attack; four lines
deep, our right rests on the top of a hill whence, as far as
the eye can reach, armed men are seen awaiting the attack
which is not made. It is a sight to remember!</p>

<p>Monday, the 16th, is also a quiet day for this campaign.
Beginning foggy and damp, with the rising sun the mists
clear away and it is very warm. On some sort of an alarm
we are deployed, in line with the One Hundred and Seventh
Pennsylvania, Colonel McCoy, that has just got back
from its home trip on account of re-enlistment. On being
recalled to our former station, we are set to work entrenching,
introducing heavy timbers into our lines of works,
three deep. About 9 p. m., we have to stop work, because
the tools are needed elsewhere. Though there are showers
in the evening, the moon finally shines through and, under
her benign light, the Regiment sleeps. Nor does the record
of the 17th differ essentially from that of yesterday.
Foggy in the morning, then clearing and warm; picket or
skirmish line duty for some and, about 4 p. m., our lines are
moved to the right, nearer those of the Ninth Corps where
there is more digging to render safe our position in case of
attack. It is about this time that General Grant finds the
army encumbered with an excess of artillery and, accordingly,
sends back to Washington over a hundred guns; how the
Johnnies would like to have some of these same weapons!
All of them will come back again before the Petersburg
siege is over.</p>

<p>Those who remember clearly the events of the 18th will
agree that the most important one was the arrival, at 5
p. m., of the first mail since leaving camp at Mitchell's
Station. What joy its contents gave those loyal hearts!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
Yet there were missives, in that coming of the postman,
for faithful lovers whose eyes, many hours before, had
closed in dreamless sleep, and in this life could never know
how fondly they were remembered. The enemy, as if to
make amends for continued quiet, began to shell the
Ninth Corps just after our early breakfast, which we had
soon after four o'clock. For some reason, General Warren
wanted our Brigade nearer him, so at seven o'clock we were
moved over towards the left and, under a shelling fire,
lay till well along in the afternoon. Though there were
six regiments in the Brigade it numbered, all told, less than
a thousand men. About two o'clock, we returned to the
right and, at eleven o'clock, reoccupied the works on which
we had labored the night before. General Warren in his
report for this day states that General Richard Coulter,
commanding our Brigade, is severely wounded. This,
too, is the day of the arrival at the Front of the First
Massachusetts Heavy Artillery from its long service in the
defenses of Washington. It is assigned to the Second
Brigade, Third Division, Second Corps, though at present
it is with the Second Brigade of General Robert O. Tyler's
Artillery Division.</p>

<p>For the greater part of the Potomac Army, the 19th is
a quiet day, though the men in their breastworks notice
some sort of change on their left. Of the day, General
Warren says, "All our forces took up position on my left.
This brought out General Ewell's Corps, who attempted
to turn our right. He was repulsed, etc.... Rained in
afternoon." Regimental note-takers remark on the drawing
of rations, including fresh beef, and the fierce attack on
their right, well along in the afternoon and of the fact that
their friends in the First Massachusetts Heavy Artillery
had a severe experience.</p>

<p>The hot reception accorded the First Heavies is worthy
of more than passing mention. Recruited to the maximum
of such organizations, the Regiment was a wonder to the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">May 18, '64</span>

men who had been long in the field, for it numbered about
1800 men, as large as two brigades of those who had been
in the thickest of the fray. The Confederates of Ewell's
command, desirous of ascertaining whether the Union
forces were moving and, incidentally, to capture if possible
a tempting wagon train, in the afternoon of the 19th,
undertook to steal around the Union right, bearing down
thus about 5 p. m. along the Fredericksburg Pike on the
line of Federal supplies. Whatever the expectations of
the enemy, the point of attack was by no means unguarded,
and in history, the engagement is known as that of the
Heavies, since not only were our First men there, but the
First Heavy of Maine was in line, and the Second, Seventh
and Eighth of New York as well. Swinton says that the
artillerists had not been in battle before, but under fire
they displayed an audacity surpassing even that of the
experienced troops. "In these murderous wood-fights,
the veterans had learned to employ all of the Indian
devices that afford shelter to the person; but these green
battalions, unused to this kind of shelter-craft, pushed
boldly on, firing furiously. Their loss was heavy, but the
honor of the enemy's repulse belongs to them." Excellent
evidence of the sturdiness and steadiness of the men, with
crossed cannon on their caps, is found in the words of an
old Confederate, spoken in 1901 at the dedication of the
regimental monument on the scene of the fight, known in

    <h2>NORTH ANNA RIVER</h2>
</div>


<p>All agree that the 20th was a quiet day, though signalized
by the arrival of a mail with so many letters and
papers that for a while the general appearance was one of
an out-of-door reading expanse, rather than a vast army
under fire from a vigilant foe, though the latter also appeared
to be quite good natured, and the bands of both
armies made the air resound with music. Even the evening
following the torrid heat of the day is described as
moonlit and beautiful. General Meade says of the 21st,
22nd and 23rd, that they were employed in moving the
army from Spottsylvania Court House to the North Anna
River, and General Warren states that his artillery began
to move at 10 a. m. of the 21st, that the enemy did some
artillery firing and that the men stood to arms. His headquarters
set out at noon. Local observers chronicle some
activity on the part of the foe with certain changes in regimental
positions and the actual starting at about noon,
leaving pickets on their stations to shift for themselves.
They march through a part of the country hitherto untouched
by Union soldiers, and the people are seemingly
badly scared. The stop for the night is at Guinea Station,
covering a distance, someone says, of eleven miles. Though
the men turn out at three o'clock in the morning of Sunday,
the 22nd, they do not advance until almost noon, and then
under a hot sun they marched ten miles to a certain Bull's
church (St. Margaret's) where are seen a number of Confederate
prisoners, and it is said that Lee passed through
in the morning. The worst feature of the march is the
fact that it is made on empty stomachs, for the rations
have not come up.</p>

<p>Of the country through which Grant and his soldiers
are making another flank movement, many remarks are
made because of its improved appearance over that of the
region about Fredericksburg and northward, where war
had been raging for three years, and it had become a veri<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>table

<span class="sidenote smcap">May 22, '64</span>

land of desolation. To the eyes of the soldiers it was
a delightful sight, and one writer in the Thirty-ninth pays
it the highest compliment possible by saying, "It looks
like New England," and the same chronicler says he can't
bear to see the men foraging for pigs, hens and everything
edible, somewhat forced thereto, on account of the wagons
being so far behind, and the tender hearted fellow continues,
much to the credit of his bringing up, "Many of the
people are poor and they need all they have for their own
keeping." In army annals, the 23rd is known as the day
of the North Anna River. In his report, General Warren
states:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"General Cutler's division leading got off promptly at 5. a. m.
Reached forks, where one road goes to the ford and one to the
bridge, at 9. a. m. Cavalry skirmishing a little in advance. A
deserter says it is Rosser's cavalry; says there is artillery and
infantry on the other side. Turned back to give that road to
Hancock and got possession of a crossing at a mill at 1 p. m.
By 3.10 p. m., General Griffin's division had nearly all forded,
and at 3.10 p. m. bridge-train began to arrive. About 4.30,
bridge (pontoon) was completed and last of General Cutler's
division crossed. About 6 a. m. enemy assaulted us. My right
gave way, and the artillery drove back the enemy. We repulsed
them everywhere."</p></div>

<p>From internal sources, we learn that the Thirty-ninth
was started out before 5 a. m., and marched rapidly
towards the North Anna. Getting on the wrong road a
halt was had for an hour, and certain portions of the Second
Corps passed by, including the Tenth Massachusetts
Battery, the old friends of Poolesville, and later we got
the right road and reached Jericho Ford, though it was
pretty deep for men of ordinary stature. However, the
crossing had been effected by others and the pontoon
bridge laid so that we went over dry shod. An attack was
made upon us soon after reaching the south side, the fight
continuing until after dark. The enemy had expected to
drive us back to the steep banks of the river, and possibly
into it, but they made the error of letting over too many of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
us, and our artillery was quite too effectual for them. The
high banks of the North Anna, would have made matters
very bad for us had not the rebel calculations miscarried.
While there was some loss, one killed in Company H, and
several wounded, the loss of the Confederates was considerable.
We lay very quietly on our arms throughout
the night, no lights being tolerated lest we might reveal
our location to the foe.</p>

<p>While the Second Corps is doing considerable fighting
on the Union left and though the Thirty-ninth shifts its
position, relatively the 24th is a quiet day. The enemy
has fallen back a mile or so and he is followed up, advantage
being taken of the opportunity to tear up some long
stretches of the railroad and to bend the rails around trees,
thus rendering them quite useless for the future. The
wagon train having crossed the river, rations for four
days are distributed and, as one man states, "They are
badly needed." Large numbers of the enemy keep coming
in, and they appear, for the most part, very glad to reach
a point where food is possible, even if the wagons are
sometimes slow in reaching us. As a variant on the unusual
quiet of the day, a heavy thunder storm imparts noise and
moisture to the scene. It is on this day that the Ninth
Corps is formally incorporated with the Army of the
Potomac, General Burnside generously waiving any rights
possessed by the priority of his commission over that of
General Meade. General Warren speaks of spending all
of the 25th in getting into position in front of the enemy's
line and driving in his (the enemy's) light troops to his
main force. "Found Hill's Corps intrenched between
the North Anna and the Little River. Lost about one
hundred and fifty men and officers during the day." During
this day, some of the men had severe experience on the
skirmish line, fully nine hours of tedious duty, with incessant
firing along the line. A severe thunder shower
marked this day also, and it was a wet earth upon which
the men undertook at last to sleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="sidenote smcap">May 25, '64</span></p>

<p>Again the flank movement had failed to discover an
assailable point in the confederate lines. They had been
thoroughly reconnoitered and "so great was the natural
strength of the ground, so well were the intrenchments
traversed, so tenacious was the Southern infantry, that it
seemed impossible to produce any serious impression upon
them. To have attacked the army of Northern Virginia
across intrenchment of the kind found here, would have involved
a useless slaughter." The Corps Commander reports
for the 26th, "Hard rain in morning at seven o'clock.
Remained in position all day. Rained in afternoon. At
dark, began to recross the North Anna River at Quarles'
Mills. Roads heavy and slippery with mud and approaches
to stream bad. All not over till near daylight." The
day proves to be more than usually wet and disagreeable,
but in the forenoon many are surprised and pleased at the
return of the men, captured on the 8th at Alsop's farm,
and retaken by Custer the next day at Beaver Dam Station,
who now rejoin the Regiment ready for duty.</p>

<p>Skirmishing continues all day and the pickets are active,
yet there is no set engagement, the head officers having
decided on still another movement towards the inevitable
left. At nine o'clock in the evening, we move out of our
works, under orders to not speak above a whisper, so that
our departure may not be suspected and the end of the 26th
of the month beholds us approaching the recrossing of the
North Anna.</p>

<p>Early in the morning of the 27th, we recross the river
and at 2.30 a. m., some distance beyond the stream must
halt and draw three days' rations, which we are told must
last us six. An hour later we are on the march and struggle
on through characteristic Virginia mud, so thick and adhesive
that many a footgear is left in its tenacious clutches.
There is very little halting for us, since we are trying to
interpose ourselves between Lee and Richmond, and we
must move more rapidly than the latter since he, being on
the arc of an inner circle, has a less distance to overcome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
than we. At eight o'clock comes a welcome halt for breakfast,
the pause being protracted for rest until nearly noon,
when we are up and off again, with very little cessation till
seven in the evening, having marched almost continuously
twenty-two hours and covering twenty-five miles. We had
not had our clothes off in twenty-four days; not a man thought
of washing his face, much less of taking a bath; nor is the
strain over yet. In what condition men, gently reared,
found themselves may be imagined. Camp is pitched near
Mangohick Church. The 28th begins as early as four o'clock,
and following breakfast the march is resumed at six, and
the Pamunkey River is crossed at Newcastle. Halting some
three miles beyond the river, breastworks are built, the
men proclaiming the digging easy, and here we halt for the
night, being about fifteen miles from Richmond, the nearest
point to the confederate capital as yet reached by the
Thirty-ninth.</p>

<p>The record for the 29th is one of marching, waiting and
digging. Though ordered out at four o'clock in the morning
with the further direction to be ready to start at five, we
wait till nearly noon, in the meantime seeing the arrival
of the Ninth Corps, after an all night's march. On starting
we find great masses of troops assembled in every direction,
our Regiment halting near the Fifth Corps' headquarters,
where we remain till near seven o'clock, when we proceed to
the left, some two and a half miles, where the Brigade throws
up breastworks; the Thirty-ninth going on picket later, the
night proving a quiet one. It would have been enjoyable
if our haversacks had not been empty, the injunction to
make our last rations hold out six days not having been
found practicable. Though we find roses in full bloom considerably
earlier than at home, this does not offset hungry
stomachs. About 7 a. m., we retire from the picket line
and join the other troops of our Corps, and after a short
march of about one mile, we draw rations of fresh beef,
which help out somewhat, and later still came the rations
we so much needed. The wagons could not come up so

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">May 31, '64</span>

one hundred men were detailed to go back to the train and
bring the food with them, this being after a day given to
efforts to repel attacks that did not seriously affect our
Regiment. Beck of "E" Company records that this day
the old Second Division got together again under the command
of Brigadier General Henry H. Lockwood, though the
fact is stated elsewhere as provisional.</p>

<div class="chapter">
    <h2>COLD HARBOR</h2>
</div>


<p>The sun of May 31st rose red and torrid and the day
proved to be terribly hot. Fortunately the exegencies of
the campaign did not require any considerable activity,
and the men had the privilege of "sweltering" in the breastworks
or of "lolling" under their shelter tents, just back of
the trenches. General Warren records of the day that
the skirmishers were pushed forward about one mile, without
opposition, beyond Bethesda Church. While there is
the sound of cannonading on both the right and left, the
last day of May, so far as our Regiment is concerned, is
the safest seen since crossing the Rapidan. The day is the
prelude to the opening of the Cold Harbor fight, one which
will cover June 1-12, and it closes with the Union forces
extending nearly North and South. White House on the
Pamunkey has become the new base of supplies and here
the Eighteenth Corps, under General W. F. Smith, landed
on the 30th, and by forced marches will be able to take
position between the Fifth and Sixth Corps on the 1st of
June. The section now harried by the opposing armies was
the scene of active warfare two years ago, for Fair Oaks
began on the 31st of May and to-morrow's Cold Harbor
will begin to repeat the horrors of the Seven Days' Fight.</p>

<p>The efforts of Generals Grant and Meade to find an
unguarded point through which the Union Army might
interpose itself between Richmond and the Confederate
Army have thus far proved unavailing. Whether active
at the head of his forces or weak and ailing, borne along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
his line in a carriage, General Lee is still untiring in his
watchfulness and, loyally supported by such lieutenants
as Ewell, Hill, Early, Anderson and others, there is always
a firm gray wall confronting the determined line in blue.
Attempts to force it had been unsuccessful at the North
Anna and Totopotomy and now, on McClellan's old battle
fields, another fierce assault is to be made on the enemy's
works, though the brunt of the charge will not come on
the Fifth Corps this day; rather will the story be told by
those who fought in the ranks of the Sixth and Eighteenth
Corps, which had gained their places, some portions thereof,
late in the afternoon, and after desperate fighting carried
certain of the Confederate defences. Turning again to
the words of General Warren, we learn that there was a
movement against the rebel position which was intrenched
with a large space of clear ground in front, swept by artillery.
The Corps suffers a loss of two hundred killed and
wounded and the line is extended four to five miles; the
Corps is attacked in several places, quite severely on the
right just before dark.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Dusseault of Company H has the following
account of the night of the 31st of May and the 1st of
June, showing very well what a portion of the Thirty-ninth
was doing:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"On the skirmish line, last night, I became completely exhausted.
We were a mile and a half in advance of our main line;
the sergeant with me was of the One Hundred and Fourth New
York; I left him in charge and went to sleep. About midnight,
when it was pitch dark, he roused me, with the words, 'They are
coming! They are coming!' It seems that the enemy were marching
in one, long, steady column towards our right. They were so
near that we could hear their voices, and their tramping shook the
earth where we lay. In the morning we found their earthworks
empty, and we so reported at headquarters. June 1st was pleasant
but hot, our skirmish line, a mile and a half from our main
line, was in the woods and close up to the enemy. At daybreak
when we found their works vacated, I reported to division officer
of the picket, Major Pierce, of the Thirteenth Massachusetts,
who ordered me to advance my line. But just as I was about to

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">May 31, '64</span>

do so, we found the enemy were moving back to our left. They
passed within three hundred feet of our picket line, thus putting
us in a precarious position. Their flankers were within two
hundred feet of us, and we did not dare to move in the hour or
more that it took them to pass. There must have been five or
six thousand of them. They finally halted and slipped into
their old works. Just then, the New York Ninth Infantry,
deployed as skirmishers advanced to relieve us, making so much
noise that they drew the enemy's fire and several of the New
York boys were killed. The rebels must have thought the whole
Yankee line was advancing, for they shelled the entire woods
severely. We lay as closely as possible, and when there was a
lull in the firing, we would fall back and thus gradually regained
the Regiment, and went to work at building breastworks. About
7 p. m., we moved to our left, into an open field, where we threw
up a new line of works, making the eighteenth that we had
started in this campaign. There was a terrible battle in progress
at our left, lasting till 9 p. m., the Sixth and Eighteenth Corps
losing heavily."</p></div>

<p>Though no part of the experience of the Fifth Corps,
it is quite in place to state that the battle which was heard
at the Union left was that of the Sixth and Eighteenth
Corps in the beginning of the sanguinary contest which
was to rage along the lines of blue and gray for almost
two weeks and which, in these, the opening hours, marked
the attempt of the above named bodies to dislodge the
Confederate divisions of Hoke, Kershaw, Pickett and
Field, reading from rebel right to left, resulting in partial
success but at the cost of between two and three thousand
men on our side. During the night of the 1st Hancock
and his Second Corps were withdrawn from the Union
right, and by dint of a very trying march were found at
the extreme Union left in the morning of the 2d of June,
yet not in time for the early charge which had been ordered
for that day. The several corps are now in order from
left to right, Second, Sixth, Eighteenth, Fifth and Ninth,
with a considerable gap between the Eighteenth and
Fifth, covered by a picket line only. Captain Porter of
the Thirty-ninth, in a paper read in 1881 before the Mili<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>tary
Historical Society of Massachusetts, refers to this
hiatus as an "interval over a most desolate piece of country,
woody, rocky, and quite hilly." The great 3rd of
June charge, that to which Grant in his Memoirs refers,
saying, "I have always regretted that the last assault
at Cold Harbor was ever made," this bloody scene, also,
was at the Union left, the brunt being borne by the Second
Corps, and in less degree only by the men of the Sixth and
Eighteenth Corps. Of the Fifth Corps, Porter says,
"Warren, who occupied a front of nearly four miles, was
altogether too much extended to allow of his having any
available force to assault with, and he was content with
carrying the enemy's skirmish line on his front." The
Ninth Corps attacked the foe with some success, pushing
its lines well to the right of the enemy's left.</p>

<p>At noon of the 3rd, owing to the opinion of the several
corps commanders that further assaults would prove
futile, General Grant issued an order to the effect that
there should be a suspension of assaults until further
notice. Then followed many days of digging, applied
to parallels and approaches and the making of reconnoisances,
thus keeping the enemy in a state of apprehension,
lest he should detach a portion of his forces to assist in the
effort to head off General Hunter in the Shenandoah
Valley. General Warren's account of the period gives very
little of interest save that on the 4th, owing to the withdrawal
of the enemy from the front of the Ninth Corps,
the latter was moved around the Fifth to the space between
the Fifth and the Eighteenth Corps. On the 5th
Warren made a reconnoisance on Shady Grove road, and
in the night withdrew to the rear, and was on the road
all night. The 6th he devoted to "putting things in order";
the 7th, he sent Griffin's and Cutler's divisions to picket
the Chickahominy, and held Ayers and Crawford to support
Burnside; 8th, 9th and 10th, remained in camp; 11th,
with all his corps, except Griffin and Cutler, to Moody's,
south of railroad, preparatory to further movement; 12th,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">June 3, '64</span>

Generals Grant and Meade reached his headquarters at
5.30 p. m. Corps started at 6 p. m. Reached vicinity of
Long Bridge before midnight.</p>

<p>The notes made at the time by men of the Thirty-ninth
consist largely of statements of moving to the right or
left and of coming back to positions formerly occupied;
of picketing and of sundry incidents, some of which are
appended, though, in the fighting for which the period
has such a bloody record, the Thirty-ninth bore a very
small part, yet it played its assigned rôle well, at no time
failing to do with alacrity whatever duty came in its way.
While not actively engaged in the assault of the 3rd, as
stated above, the men were all on the alert and anxiously
expectant. On the 2nd General Lockwood, who had commanded
the reorganized Second Division a few days, was
relieved and ordered to Baltimore, there to await further
orders. His methods were not to the liking of General
Warren. The general trend of the army was towards
the left, and in two installments the Corps marched on
the 5th several miles, fetching up at midnight at Cold
Harbor, near the fighting points of the 1st and 3rd days
of the month, camping in the rear of the Second Corps.
Here follow three days of relative peace and quiet, in
which rations are drawn, cooked and consumed with relish
and dispatch. "The quietest time since the 3rd of May"
is the record of one observer, and another says, "It seems
nice to be free from firing all the while, though the bugles
keep us in touch with camp life." Baggage wagons get
up on the 6th and officers, after picking out their valises
are able to enjoy a change of linen and, on this day, is
promulgated the order that our old brigade relations are
changed and the whole organization is transferred to the
Second Brigade of the Third Division, the latter being
under the command of General S. W. Crawford while
Colonel Lyle remains at the head of the Brigade. The
day also marks a slicking up time, the camp being policed
and the quartermaster deals out much needed wearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
apparel. Our camp is not far from the headquarters of
General Warren. Our change to the Third Division also
changes the hue of our corps badge, the maltese cross, from
white to blue.</p>

<p>On the 7th, B. H. Dow, the only man wounded at Mine
Run, returns to his "C" Company. That an unusual
degree of quiet prevailed in these days appears when, on
the 9th, the wagons brought up a desk for the adjutant,
the bands begin to play again, drilling is resumed and the
Second Brigade has a dress parade, but the event of all
which pleased the Thirty-ninth most was the return of
Lieutenant Colonel Peirson, who had been absent after
his wounding at Laurel Hill. One of the boys thus entered
the incident in his diary: "We cheered him heartily; a
brave man commands the respect of all; his patriotism
cannot be questioned, when he has the privilege of a furlough
of thirty days, but instead of taking it comes back
to his Regiment."</p>

<p>In Charles E. Davis's history of the Thirteenth Massachusetts
Infantry, we may read an excellent statement
of the soldiers' feelings toward General Grant:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"No matter what happened, we moved forward. No backward
steps were taken&mdash;an experience to which the Army of
the Potomac, hitherto, had been unused. The consequence was
that the "Old Man," as General Grant was called, was always
greeted with genuine enthusiasm, though he didn't seem to care
very much for it. In his old blouse and hat he appeared like the
rest of us,&mdash;ragged and dirty. Once when we passed him, he sat
on a platform car, gnawing away on an old ham bone. As the
boys cheered him, he gave the bone a flourish for a second, and
then went on gnawing it as though we were miles away. It was
wonderful how thoroughly this retiring, undemonstrative man
had gained the confidence of the army. In spite of the hard
work we had been having, the men were in good spirits, pleased
that at last we were accomplishing something."</p></div>

<p>The 7th marks the departure from the corps of the
Eighty-third New York, Ninth Militia of the Second
Brigade, its terms of enlistment having expired, and it is to

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">June 7, '64</span>

offset the going home of regiments, through reaching
their end of service, that great numbers of recruits are
coming in constantly. In the case of the Eighty-third,
so severe has been its losses, it takes away only one hundred
and fifty men. The ninth day gives the men a new
exhibition, that of a correspondent of the Philadelphia
Inquirer being escorted through the army by a Provost
Marshal's guard, bearing on his back, a board labelled,
"Libeller of the Press," on account of certain libellous
letters he had written to his paper. However sad the man
may have been, through his punishment, his plight affords
the observers a deal of amusement. During these days mails
arrive and depart and, after the complete rest of a few days,
to the survivors of the May experience, life really seems
to be worth living. With the 11th is associated the memory
of reveillé at four o'clock, breakfast at six, and then a march
which takes us across the York and Richmond Railroad
at about 11 a. m. and a mile or so south of it we halt for
dinner. The march ends near Bottom's Bridge on the
Chickahominy River, camps being pitched on the very
ground occupied by McClellan's troops two years before.
The 12th is Sunday and so long has been the interval since
religious services were held, some men are glad of the
chance to hear a Christian Commission man preach; and
the Thirty-ninth is inspected by Colonel Lyle, brigade
commander. At 7 p. m. the line of march is once more
taken up and we proceed some miles towards the east,
halting at eleven o'clock for a rest and supper.</p>

    <h2>TOWARDS THE JAMES RIVER</h2>
</div>


<p>The veteran soldiers who are participating in this southward
movement, though they may not know the details that
are in the minds of Grant and Meade, are well aware that
the grand purpose announced in the Wilderness is still
being developed and, that the "summer-long line" is that
which they are following. The Lieutenant General, hav<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>ing
found the way too effectually blocked via Cold Harbor
as early as the 5th of June, when Warren's men were withdrawn
and sent towards the left of the Union line, had
determined to change his base of operations and, after
crossing the James, to lay siege to Petersburg, and thus
to capture the Capital of the Confederacy. The pause
of the Fifth Corps for several days had given the men the
necessary rest and recuperation for the lead they were
to take in the new flank movement and now, just before
midnight of the 12th of June, they are awaiting the completion
of a pontoon bridge over which they may pass to
the south side and so hold the way open for the other troops
to follow. General Warren refers to the locality as Long
Bridge, but the map which accompanies Humphreys'
"Campaign of '64 and '65" has it as "Long's Bridge,"
but in either case, whether called for its length or some
family resident near, the structure had disappeared through
the ravages of war, and a temporary bridge becomes a
necessity.</p>

<p>The Journal of the Fifth Corps Commander for this
13th of June has the following entry:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Our cavalry drove back the enemy's to New Market Cross
Roads. Crawford's (Third) Division went to White Oak Swamp
bridge to cover passage of trains and Second Corps. At 8 a. m.
began to withdraw, bothered by McIntosh's (union) cavalry brigade,
and only got as far as St. Mary's Church, though traveling
nearly all night. Enemy did not follow."</p></div>

<p>Lieut. John H. Dusseault says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"On June 13, we resumed our march at 1 a. m., and crossed the
Chickahominy near Long Bridge, on pontoons, just before daylight.
There was some slight skirmishing. At 6 a. m., we
marched for two hours, covering about two miles only, and formed
in line of battle. We were now in White Oak Swamp, between
the James River and the Chickahominy, and the skirmishing
was lively. We were marching on a straight road and we
could see a fort nearly a mile in front of us. They opened upon
us from the fort, and the first shell struck the road before it
reached our column. The men opened to the right and left, and

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">June 13, '64</span>

the shell ricocheted down between them. We then left the
road and went into the fields and woods. If I remember correctly
we went to the left of the road. Our Brigade advanced some ways
in the direction of Richmond, which was perhaps seven or eight
miles away, the balance of the division remaining in the rear as a
support. We did some light skirmishing during the afternoon,
and the enemy charged some dismounted cavalry, who were
located upon our right, and drove them back some distance.
Shortly after dark, somewhere between 8 and 9 p. m., all of the
officers of the brigade were ordered up to Colonel Lyle's (the
Brigade's) headquarters. The Colonel told us of the position
which we were in, stating that we were nearly surrounded, and
that an attempt would be made at about midnight to get out.
He also told us to tell our men of our position, also that no orders
above a whisper should be given, and, that if we heard so much as
a tin dipper jingling upon a man's haversack, to cut it off. We
were told to get what rest we could between then and midnight.
At about midnight the line fell in, seemingly without orders,
faced to the left, and marched through a field where some tall
grain was growing, and the men, knowing our position and being
anxious to get out, kept increasing their pace and rattling the
grain, so that it was necessary to halt them and to start them
again from time to time until we had cleared the grain field. The
night was very dark and the darkness favored our escape. We
started again at Charles City Court House, not far from the
James. At this time the Second Corps was crossing the James.
We then found that while we were making this demonstration
toward the enemy and occupying their attention, Grant had been
moving the chief part of the army across the peninsular, toward
the James River, and Petersburg. In fact, when we arrived, the
Ninth Corps had crossed and the Second Corps was crossing the
James. We crossed the James on the 16th, on the transport
General Howard and were landed upon the Petersburg side at
9 a. m. I was told by another officer that it was understood that
it was necessary that some small portion of the army should make
this demonstration and occupy the attention of the enemy while
the chief part of it should be crossing to the Petersburg side of
the James and it was thought to be our turn to take the risk which
attended it. General Warren is said to have remarked that he
never expected to see us again."</p></div>

<p>After dark, we were withdrawn and started on a march
which involved the taking of a wrong road and the consequent
loss of valuable time, passing St. Mary's Church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
and just before daybreak of the 14th halted on the road to
Charles City Court House. Starting again at six, by ten
o'clock we were near the place named for that unfortunate
British King who lost both crown and head, the place
showing plainly the effect of McClellan's presence two
years before. Were it not for the Court House itself, a
one-storied edifice with a porch, and a blacksmith shop
the place would be scarcely more than a name, but some
one remarks, "We must be getting somewhere for I can
hear the steamers whistle on the James River." Had we
been supplied with rations our pleasure at the prospect
and the rest would have been greater, but our haversacks
were quite empty. However, we could go to sleep, which
we proceeded to do at the early hour of eight o'clock.</p>

<p>The 15th was not eventful save as it brought the long
expected wagon train and rations galore. There was a
complete filling of all receptacles with the necessities of
army life, and after stuffing ourselves with hardtack and
the other good things that those wagons carried we were
in a mood to enjoy ourselves, though we couldn't help
wishing that the mail would come, bringing news from
the far-away homes in the North. With a sort of forewarning
that exactions would be made upon our vigor and
strength on the morrow, again we turned in early. Sure
enough we were turned out at two o'clock in the morning
of the 16th for a march of three miles to Wilcox's Wharf
on the banks of the James and the sight of the glorious
river and the banks, in many cases, crowned with the
mansions of aristocratic Virginians. The entire country,
robed in the brightest of green, was one to make an indelible
impression on the memory. The Thirty-ninth crossed
the river on the transports, "General Howard," "George
Weems" and possibly others, and by 9 a. m. we were all
on the southern side. Here we found the Seventh Massachusetts,
an Old Colony regiment, just taking boat for
home. A splendid fighting body of men, they had earned
the long rest that was coming to them. The pause, when

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">June 16, '64</span>

over the river, afforded an opportunity for a plunge into
the waters of the classic James, a chance that thousands
of the men embraced, the very first one since crossing
the Rapidan, and many declared that in all their army
experience they had found no place equal to it, certainly
none that they enjoyed more.</p>

<p>Concerning this movement to the south of the James, a
dispatch was sent from army headquarters to Washington
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Our forces withdrew from within fifty yards of the enemy's
entrenchments at Cold Harbor, made a flank movement of about
fifty-five miles march, crossing the Chickahominy and James
Rivers, the latter two thousand feet wide and eighty-four feet
deep at the point of crossing, and surprised the enemy's rear at
Petersburg."</p></div>

<div class="chapter">
    <h2>PETERSBURG</h2>
</div>


<p>The long-continued battle of Petersburg had already
begun before we were in battle line. General Butler, on
the other side of the Appomattox, on this Thursday
morning through General Terry, had assaulted Port
Walthall with the intention of interrupting the coming of
rebel re-inforcements on the Richmond &amp; Petersburg
Railroad and, the night before, troops of the Eighteenth
Corps, which had been with us at Cold Harbor, had
attacked south of the river, and had there been a supporting
force at hand, the second as well as the first line of
works might have been carried. As troops of the Second
Corps came up they were sent against the works and,
during the night and the following day, the 16th, the contest
continued along the line composed of the Eighteenth
Corps on the right, the Second in the centre and the
Ninth on the left. All this while we of the Fifth Corps
were sporting in the waters of the James. Meanwhile
other portions of the Fifth Corps had gone forward, and
at four o'clock in the afternoon the Thirty-ninth with its
neighbors started on the road to Petersburg. After covering
some ten miles of the way, we halted at 10.30 p. m. for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
food and rest, the route having been over hills and through
swamps, difficult at the best, all the more so at night.</p>

<p>It was early in the morning of the 17th when the march
was resumed, and at 9 a. m. we halted in the rear of breastworks,
our entire route having been enlivened by the
sound of firing, more or less vigorous, indicating a resumption
of the days at Spottsylvania and Cold Harbor. Moreover,
Massachusetts men do not forget that it is the 17th
of June, and noise they had grown to think a regular
accompaniment of that illustrious date. We are at the
Union left and massed in the rear of the Ninth Corps, under
Burnside, and the duty of our Corps is to act as a support
of the Ninth if needed. We are about two miles from
Petersburg and from many points the city is plainly seen.
The cupola of Dinwiddie County Court House will be a
target for Union artillery during many coming months.
Lying in the breastworks through the day and night, we
were exposed to the missiles of the enemy; Lieut Wyman of
"H" and Captain Willard Kinsley of "K" as well as
others were wounded. Unless he could sleep in the direst
confusion there was no closing of the eyelids during this
first night in front of Petersburg. In this memorable
siege, the 18th of June is a notable date, for then there was
concerted action along the entire line, though not in such
uniform time and order as General Meade desired. It was
a bloody day in which a vigorous effort was made to force
the rebel lines before the arrival of help from the Northward.
This might have been done earlier in the day, but,
before the advance could be made, re-inforcements had
arrived to nearly, if not quite, equal the number of the
Union soldiers, and General Meade's orders were to hold
what had been gained and to fortify immediately. The
casualties of the four days, 15th-18th, footed up nearly two
thousand killed and more than eight thousand wounded,
the charges of this 18th day ending assaults on intrenched
positions. The work of the Fifth Corps is thus described
by a war correspondent:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">June 18, '64</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"On the left of the Ninth was the Fifth Corps, in the following
order of divisions: from right to left&mdash;Crawford (3), Griffin (1),
Cutler (4), Ayers (2). At early morning the advance was made
and the enemy's withdrawal discovered. The Corps then prepared
for a new advance, meanwhile keeping up a fierce fire of
infantry and artillery. At noon, simultaneously with the attack
of the Second Corps, a determined and vigorous advance was
made. The ground to be crossed was generally open and cultivated,
slightly rolling, and here and there artificially prepared
with abatis, as well as naturally defended by undergrowth. The
advance was against the south side of the Norfolk Railroad, and
was partially, but not fully successful. In the evening again, at
the time of Mott's attack in the centre (when the First Maine
Heavy Artillery was so badly cut up) Griffin's and Cutler's
divisions once more assaulted with great vigor. But here as
before the labor was lost. The enemy foiled all our desperate
endeavors."</p></div>

<p>The advance of the First Brigade, Third Division, is
made at daybreak and we find the enemy missing. We
are passing over surface which was fighting ground yesterday
and last night; encountering the dead in both blue
and gray, a most gruesome sight, at the same time driving
back the rebel skirmishers until we come in sight of the
Confederate earthworks, when we halt and throw up
works for our own protection. Even danger and death
can not wipe out human or, at least, boyish nature. Near
the brief halting place are mulberry trees, fairly black with
luscious, well ripened fruit, and not even rebel riflemen
can keep Yankee berry-pickers out of those tempting
branches. We soon advance, however, across a field and
towards a railroad-cut some distance ahead of us, and to
reach it we have to run the risk of the foe's rifles and
cannon, snugly entrenched beyond the cut. We make a
rush for this cut and the tumbles that some of the men take
in entering it are funny even in battle's din. Colonel
Davis's well known avoirdupois gained such momentum
in the rapid rush that halting on the brink was quite
impossible, and he rolled rapidly down the declivity.
There is skirmishing all day and an artillery duel in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
afternoon. Just at dark, a rapid movement is made
across a ravine and orders are quietly passed that when
the Colonel's hat is raised on the point of his sword, we are
to rush forward to the edge of a bank, so near and yet so
far below the rebel works that they cannot depress their
cannon sufficiently to hit us. Officers are summoned later
to brigade headquarters where they are informed that
there will be a night attack, but, for some reason, changes
come in the programme and in a new position we again
throw up breastworks. In an exposed condition, we lie in
them through the night and are saluted in the morning of
Sunday, the 19th, by the enemy's fire at closer range.</p>

<p>The 19th falls on Sunday, though the particular day of
the week gives these soldiers very little concern, since
each successive twenty-four-hours is only one day more of
"smoke and roar and powder-stench" and of this particular
interval, General Warren has only the words, "Remained
in position. Loss about three hundred." If
remaining in position brought such a record as this, what
would it have been had there been another effort to advance?
The night before had seen very vigorous work in the
trenches and men tried to strengthen them against possible
attack, and so close were the workman to each other and
so emphatic their strokes, George A. Farrar of "E" was
wounded in the knee by a pickaxe and was obliged to go
to the hospital. Nothing in the world finds more ready and
willing workers than the throwing up of breastworks that
may be used for defense and, under the spur of hostile
missiles, the laziest become most industrious. At such
times there are no suggestions that the other fellow ought
to do it, but everyone is doing something, if it is no more
than loosening earth with a bayonet or case-knife and
throwing up the results with a cup or tin-plate, hoping
thus to stop a vagrant bullet. Continuous rattle of musketry
recalls the noise of the Wilderness and, with the
evident skill of the sharpshooters, it behooves everyone to
lie low. Writes one poor fellow, somewhat discouraged,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">June 19, '64</span>

"When shall we get through this terrible campaign?"
Another says, "The Thirty-ninth is about five hundred
yards (others put the distance as low as eighty yards) from
the Confederate works and our skirmishers are on a hillside,
across a ravine. At nightfall, we begin on the works
again." This, doubtless, is the point referred to by Captain
Porter, years afterward, when at a reunion of the
Regiment, he said, "our skirmishers were among the first
to establish the line at what was afterward the Crater,
blown up on the 30th of July, 1864, and that line was
pushed nearest to the rebel line, not excepting that of
Fort Stedman and Fort McGilvery, by twenty yards."</p>

<p>Of the 20th, an officer records, "We worked till two o'clock
last night, and turned out at four this morning. The rebel
sharpshooters are on the lookout for a man careless enough
to show himself. I am twenty-four years old to-day."
Another scribe in the same company enters these words,
"Wish I were at home to-day for it is our boy's birthday,"
so closely does the absent soldier keep in heart and mind
to the loved ones at the hearthstone. While there is a
trend towards the west, General Griffin's Division (First)
reaching the Jerusalem plank-road and the Second Corps
crossing it, our portion of the Fifth Corps, except as a
part of the Brigade moves off to the left to help fill the gap
made by the withdrawal of Griffin, remains as before.
The 21st varies little from yesterday, men keeping pretty
closely to their places, the least exposure bringing attention
from the enemy, and men are wounded in spite of all
care to the contrary. One of Burnside's colored regiments
is digging a traverse out to the picket line. Extreme
vigilance continues into the night, through fear of an assault
by the enemy, and at about 9 p. m., the most of the
Regiment goes on picket. Picket duty on the 22nd requires
vigilance, "Yank" and "Reb" exchange compliments
whenever opportunity offers and Jonas P. Barden, Company
A, is killed. Quite late in the evening, the Regiment
is relieved and retires to its former location, the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
being not remote from the spot which in a few weeks
would be known as the "Crater," and somewhat further
to the Union left, opposite prominencies will be called
Forts Sedgwick and Mahone, or in army parlance, Forts
"Hell and Damnation." It is on this day that the Second
Corps suffers one of the severest set backs in its entire
history, the enemy succeeding in getting at its left flank,
in a manner unprecedented, and in carrying off four
cannon and more than two thousand prisoners.</p>

<p>Everyone is learning caution, but there are mortalities
still, as with S. B. Harris of "H" who is hit in the head
and killed on the 23rd. It is fair to suppose that Union
sharpshooters are just as vigilant as their opponents, and
that Death visits, with no show of partiality, both blue
and gray. As the stay in these advanced trenches has not
savored at all of rest, any change seems desirable, hence
orders to move early in the morning of the 24th are heard
with pleasure and, before daylight, we are off to the left
to take the places of Second Corps men who had gone
still further to the left, while the Ninth Corps moves into
our vacated places. One very careful observer states
that we lost our way and had to back and fill, as it were,
at one time coming near running into the enemy, who
kept up an almost constant shelling during the change.
There seems to be less activity among the sharpshooters,
for which the soldiers are duly grateful. To-day the
original members of the Twelfth Massachusetts, the
Fletcher Webster Regiment, long in the Second Brigade
of our Division, draw out of line and start for home. The
recruits, re-enlisted and drafted men of the Twelfth are
to become a part of the Thirty-ninth. The coming into
our ranks of one hundred and twenty-five men from the
returning Twelfth, is the crowning incident of the 25th.
One hundred and six more men are nominally transferred,
but they are absent on sick leave, in rebel prisons or elsewhere,
and those received to-day, represent about all the
real additions to come from our friends who, after three

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">June 24, '64</span>

years of arduous labor, are homeward bound. The new
position of the Regiment is across the Petersburg &amp; Norfolk
Railroad and the depleted condition of the 39th,
following the campaign, is evident from the fact that eighteen
of the men from the Twelfth Regiment, added to those
left in Company C of the Thirty-ninth, called for just
forty three rations in the entire company.</p>

<p>It was not lack of excitement which prompted a certain
Company A man to a prank which afforded him and his
comrades a deal of pleasure, rather was it a desire for something
out of the ordinary that, in the midst of this, the
severest campaign in the progress of the war, suggested
to him a variation. Taking pencil and paper, he wrote,
"I should be happy to correspond with any young lady so
disposed; address G. W. Cheney, Company A, 39th
Regt., M. V. M., Second Brigade, Third Division, Fifth
Army Corps, Army of the Potomac." Thinking the idea
too good to be kept secret, he read it to the boys around
the campfire who were delighted with the plan and he
had to write another, couched thus, "I would be pleased to
correspond with young ladies, 18 to 22, with view to
matrimony." Both of the ads were sent to the Boston
Herald and the writer thinks they were the first of the
kind ever inserted there. Two weeks later, or after the
ads had had time to circulate, the mail brought one hundred
and six answers, representing every state then in
the Union; long letters, short and pithy ones, some perfumed
and embossed; no end of good advice, love, kisses,
merry, sporting fun and blessings; it was understood that
the Colonel's good wife was quite horrified at seeing the
ad and there must have been some uxorious advice to
Colonel Davis since, though the next mail had over two
hundred letters for the advertisers, they were all destroyed
on the pretext that there were no such persons in the
Regiment as those addressed. This however did not prevent
the enterprising young men doing extensive corresponding
over their own names.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>The 26th is a quiet day; the 27th has its alarms with
prompt response but no attack. Long desired rain fell
along towards night, but not enough to satisfy the overheated
men and the thirsty earth; so near are pickets of
the opposing armies, they could readily converse without
raising their voices, but they have not, as yet, reached
that degree of familiarity. The 28th, Tuesday, marks a
change in the situation in that we move to the front and
right and proceed to throw up a line of earthworks, stronger
than those already in use with the expectation of thereby
affording shelter for suddenly attacked pickets and to
better resist any assault of the enemy. The month of June
ends with the Corps stretched along the Petersburg line,
with the Ninth and Eighteenth at the right and the Second
and the Sixth at its left. By seeming common consent,
pickets cease firing, though the heavy guns thunder away;
evidently both Johnnie and Yankee would like a rest;
after extremely hard work, the regimental rolls are got
into shape for muster which is had on the 30th; another
sign of semi-permanency is the coming up of some of the
sutlers who are anxious to resume operations, especially
in view of the possible coming of the paymaster. It is
in these days that the 1st Massachusetts Heavy Artillery,
Second Corps, which received so severe a handling at
Harris's Farm, May 19th, yet most manfully held its
place, is once more encountered and the ravages of war
were never more apparent than in the fact that only three
hundred are reported present for duty out of eighteen
hundred men who left the defenses in the month of May.</p>

<p>The first third of July, as far as the Thirty-ninth is
concerned, is quite uneventful. The comparative quiet
that the men are experiencing has become a necessity.
The persistent bending of the bow, beginning at the
Wilderness, is bringing expected results. The fire of conscious
strength, so evident in the earlier encounters of
the campaign, is nearly burned out and recent trials of
courage and endurance have shown and, future struggles

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">July, '64</span>

will exhibit, a lacking of that enthusiasm which characterized
the early days of May. Human bodies cannot
endure everything, their limitations are sooner or later
determined and such is the case with these survivors of
the terrible exactions so continuously made. General
F. A. Walker says, "Men died of flesh wounds which, at
another time, would merely have afforded a welcome
excuse for a thirty days' sickness leave. The limit of human
endurance had been reached." General Grant, in his
Memoirs, writes of the situation after the assault on the
18th of June, "I now ordered the troops to be put under
cover, and allowed some of the rest which they had so
long needed." It is a protraction of this rest that our
men are getting in earlier July. From the 1st to the 10th
of the month, the diary of General Warren has no entry
of greater importance than reference to the building of
a redoubt or the development of some plan on paper and,
though constant vigilance is evident, there are none of
the exposure and tests characteristic of the Wilderness
and Spottsylvania.</p>

<p>To supplement the somewhat stilted rations furnished
by the commissary department, the sanitary commission
is sending in a variety of vegetables, fresh and dried, as
well as fruits that are most gratefully received by the men
and they are working a great improvement in general
health. In our Regiment, appearances begin to resemble
those of winter quarters since roll calls, three times a day,
are in order, falling-in with guns and equipments. Ground
is cleared for inspection and those formal ordeals are had
as of old, and guns have to be cleaned up accordingly;
prayer-meetings also are resumed. The 4th, usually so
noisy at home, is just the reverse in our particular locality,
though away off to the right, Butler and Smith fire salutes.
In the Fifth Corps, the impression apparently is that we
have had noise enough of late. In the evening, the pickets
on both sides celebrate a bit with cheers, perhaps in behalf
of ancestors who, both North and South, fought for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
a common cause. The weather continues very hot and
mutual forbearance permits the men to stretch their tents
as awnings back of the earthworks into which they are
ready to tumble instantly, should occasion arise. Heavy
details are made of men for labor on a new fort in process
of erection to the southwest of our position, to be called,
at first, Fort Warren, but later to take the name of our
Colonel who, all unconscious of the fact, is rapidly
approaching the day of his departure. On the 7th of July
the Third Division of the Sixth Corps is detached and,
by way of the James and Chesapeake Bay, is sent to Baltimore
to head off near Frederick, Maryland, the movement
of General Early and his men on Washington. This
Confederate officer had been ordered to leave the vicinity
of Cold Harbor on the 13th of June, and to proceed towards
the Shenandoah Valley for the purpose of making trouble
for General David Hunter, who had been operating in
that section, Lee evidently thinking that his lessened
battle front could afford the withdrawal. A considerable
battle followed on the 9th, at Monocacy Junction, where
Lew Wallace with a force made up of local militia and
certain Ohio one hundred days' men and the Third Division
of the Sixth Corps, was able to hold the Confederates
long enough to permit the arrival in Washington of the
remaining two divisions of the Sixth, the same leaving
City Point the night of the 9th, and to successfully repel
the rebel assault upon Fort Stevens on the 12th. Considerable
effort was necessary to persuade General Grant
that any portion of the Confederate army was missing
from his front, luckily he was convinced in time to send
a sufficient force to Washington to destroy all of Early's
expectations.</p>

<p>The comparative calm of the first third of July was
rudely broken on the 11th. The day had begun much
as usual and, from five o'clock in the morning till five-thirty
in the afternoon, there was the regular round of camp and
other duties when, for some unexplained reason, the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">July 11, '64</span>

enemy began a fierce fire of artillery on our rations-train.
As hitherto, nearly all of the shells exploded way back of
our lines but one, and a man states distinctly in his diary,
"the only one," struck close beside Colonel Davis and,
exploding, wounded him so severely that he died very
soon afterward, 7 p. m. Private Mentzer of "A," long
years later, recalls the sad happening thus: "Streets,
tents, stockades, properly aligned; camps, graded and
drained; constant discipline, inspections, dress parades,
deportment, all better than those of any other regiment I
ever saw, tell me that Colonel Davis did his work thoroughly
and well. He sat on a rustic seat or bench, talking
with a friend (Asst. Surgeon of the Thirteenth), none other
near, save a detail of pickets, of whom I was one, just reported
at headquarters, when a shell burst and tore his
body dreadfully, still he was the commander to the end."</p>

<p>Lieut. J. H. Dusseault, "H," describes the sad event thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The first shot fired, which we were wont to call the five o'clock
express, hit a tree about fifty feet in front of our lines, cutting
it off some forty feet from the ground; the rebels were really
shelling our baggage train, some distance in the rear. Hitting
the tree deflected the shell so that it passed downward through
the canopy of leaves, arranged for shade above the officers'
quarters, and burst under the Colonel, who was sitting cross-legged
on a rustic seat with Assistant Surgeon L. W. Hixon of
the Thirteenth Massachusetts. Both men were thrown down
and the lower part of Colonel Davis' body seemed completely
torn to pieces. My own quarters being not more than ten feet
away, I was able to see the missile as it passed downward, after
striking the tree. I helped pull the Colonel into his pit. His
mind was clear and I heard him converse with Lieut. Colonel
Peirson to the purport that he would be colonel now. To this
Colonel Peirson replied, 'Oh no! You are going to get out of
this.' The wounded officer, however, insisted that it was all
over with him and he gave certain directions to the Lieut. Colonel
saying that he would like to have him recommend Capt. F. R.
Kinsley to be Lieut. Colonel and, his passion for details being
strong even in death, he named a member of the drum-corps,
who had overstayed his leave of absence and wanted him attended
to when he returned. He requested also that a letter he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
had just written to his wife should be mailed and that the circumstances
of his death should be added. Dr. Hixon, proclaiming
himself also wounded, said he was unable to attend to the
dying officer and it is possible that the surgeon of the First Massachusetts
Heavy Artillery was called in to help dress the wound.
After this he was placed on a stretcher and William S. Sumner of
"H" was one of the men who carried him to the rear. As the
enemy was shelling the road, they felt obliged to carry him through
the woods and the way being very rough, the officer suffering
terribly said to the bearers, 'Men, I wish you would take the road,
I hate to ask you to do so, but this is terrible.' He died about
the time the hospital was reached. A veteran of the Thirteenth
Regiment claims to have a piece of the shell which killed Colonel
Davis."</p></div>

<p>At this very time Colonel Davis was president of a court
martial at the headquarters of the Third Division and had
been there earlier in the day but, as the business in hand
was not in proper shape, the court did not convene and its
president returned to his Regiment. Had it been in progress,
the chances are that our colonel would not have
passed out of life as he did. John S. Beck, "C," detailed
as a clerk at the court martial, writes thus: "I did not
think it was the last time I should ever see him.... I felt
very badly about it, for he seemed like a father to me.
The boys felt blue enough. I think it will be hard to fill
his place. I turned in feeling very sad and downcast."<a name="FNanchor_N_14" id="FNanchor_N_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_N_14" class="fnanchor">[N]</a></p>

<p>As with Tennyson's Brook, "Men may come and men
may go," but the war "goes on." The gallant officer, into
whose care the dying colonel committed the Regiment, was
fully equal to the task. A member of the famous Fourth
Battalion, which served its period of volunteer duty in
Fort Warren at the breaking out of the war entirely without
compensation, he had been one of the first to volunteer
in the Twentieth Massachusetts where he was first lieutenant
and adjutant and, captured at Ball's Bluff, had experienced</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
<span class="sidenote smcap">July 11, '64</span>

Richmond inhospitality. Then as a staff officer,
he had seen the fierce Peninsula campaign along with
Generals Dana and Sedgwick. An early selection of Governor
Andrew, he was made second to Colonel Davis in the
raising of the Thirty-ninth and we have grown pretty well
acquainted with him during the preceding months. As
close to the enemy at Laurel Hill as he well could be, he
was severely wounded and he now takes his promotion
with the good will and thorough loyalty of every officer
and man under his command. Major Henry M. Tremlett
who was still absent on detached service in Boston becomes
lieutenant colonel, and Captain F. R. Kinsley of the
Somerville Company, "E," succeeds Tremlett as major.</p>

<p>Were this history that of the entire war or even that of
the Army of the Potomac, the story of the remaining days
of July would occupy very little space, for the siege of
Petersburg, actually beginning on the 15th of June, is to
continue until the 2nd of April, '65, and may be characterized
as an unbroken engagement of almost ten months'
duration with occasional extra emphasis laid on this or
that point along the battle line, many miles in extent.
Away at the right is the Eighteenth Corps, holding the
space from the Appomattox to the Ninth Corps which
stretches out till its left joins the right of the Fifth, which
in turn touches the right of the Second; this corps since
the withdrawal of the Sixth for service in Maryland, in
Washington and later in the valley of the Shenandoah, has
become the extreme Union left, with its line refused
towards the south, and west of the Jerusalem plank-road,
only a fraction of the distance to be covered before the
winter's stay is ended. Even now the enemy is making
vigorous effort to defend the several railroads which
connect Petersburg with the south, feeling certain that
Grant and Meade will not long delay trying to cut off the
city from its Weldon Railroad connections and, until that
time arrives, there will be more digging than charging
along the rival lines, though the exchange of sulphurous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
compliments will be so constant that cessation rather than
continuance will arouse remark.</p>

<p>General Warren, who has his command well in hand,
has no conspicuous statement for this period, and even
some regimental historians pass over the interval with
only a few and scattering remarks. It will be understood
that the most diligent picket and camp duties are maintained
all of the time, and very few if any idle days come to either
commissioned officer or enlisted man from one week's
end to another. Never was there a better illustration of
eternal vigilance than that displayed by both sides in this
long game of opposites; hence in our progress it will be
unnecessary to mention more than the passing events, in
the least out of the ordinary. Colonel Thomas F. McCoy
of the One hundred and Seventh Pennsylvania succeeds
Colonel Davis as president of the court martial, while the
body of the deceased officer, with his faithful steed and
Chaplain French, starts July 12th on its long journey homeward.
Many a member of the Regiment felt, if he did not
so express himself, as did the writer who put these words
in his diary, "I can't realize that he has really gone and
will not be with us at the front again." Early in the morning
of this day, the Regiment is aroused and at 2.30 a. m.
moves into the large fort or redoubt, for some time in
process of erection. Of this, General Warren makes mention,
saying that he spent the day here, planning and
cutting timber, etc. At daylight of the 13th, everyone
goes to work with pick or shovel in making defensible the
new fort. Here we are to remain till the middle of August.
Named at first for the commander of the Fifth Corps, it
will soon take the name of our late colonel. Covering
about three acres of ground, it is capable of holding a
brigade. Situated a mile or more below Petersburg, it is
on the Jerusalem plank-road and the next fortification
south of Sedgwick, the Fort "Hell" of rebel parlance.
Lieutenant Dusseault says, "In building our fort, we
dug a trench twenty feet wide and ten feet deep, and threw

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">July 13, '64</span>

up the rampart on the inside. Thus there were eighteen or
twenty feet of banking. The fort was made square with a
diagonal through it. We had a magazine in it, and two
wells were dug for a water supply. Besides our Brigade
there was with us also the Ninth (Bigelow's) Battery,
which had suffered so severely at Gettysburg."</p>

<p>The routine of duty, including at least three hours' work
daily on the fortifications, continues to-day, and all day
and all night, too, for that matter, since the stronghold
must be one in fact as well as name, men being so detailed
as to keep the dirt flying; a writer in the story of the
Thirteenth Massachusetts Infantry says it took eight men
to get one shovelful of dirt from the bottom of the ditch to
the top of the work, the men standing in little nitches cut
in the side of the bank and passing the earth from one to
another. This day also marks the transferral of recruits
and re-enlisted men of the Thirteenth Regiment, the time
of this staunch companion on many a march and hard
fought field having expired and the original members
being about to withdraw for their joyful journey home,
though the actual union of the one hundred remaining men
of the Thirteenth and the Thirty-ninth does not take place
till the 14th of July, the only noteworthy event of the day,
unless mention is made of the withdrawal of the Second
Corps from its western position and its encampment south
of the Fifth Corps, thus leaving the Fifth at the extreme
Union left. On the Fifteenth the camp ground is thoroughly
policed and General Warren superintends the laying
out of a camp for the men and pitching our tents, regular
living seems probable for a time at least. It is related that,
reviewing some of the work as already laid out, General
Warren, who had been Meade's chief engineer, asked who
had projected certain lines and, when a division commander
was named, he sharply remarked, "General &mdash;&mdash;
had better stick to his pills," and seizing a shovel worked
off some of his indignation by making the dirt fly with his
major general hands. The Masonic Lodge held its first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
meeting for many a day and voted to pay for the embalming
of Colonel Davis' body, and the expenses incident
to sending it home, also appointing a committee to look
after the families of brother Masons killed in the campaign.</p>

<p>The passion or appetite for drink is well illustrated on
the 17th in Lieut. Dusseault's effort to properly distribute
eight canteens (twelve quarts) of whiskey among one
hundred men, on police duty, the ration being one gill for
each one but, for fear that the quantity might intoxicate
them, he discreetly gave out one half a gill per man, thus
retaining four canteens for a subsequent occasion. When
he lay down at night he put the canteens under his head,
but despite his care the canteens were stolen with no clue
to the thieves, save the maudlin condition in which several
men were found. There seemed to be no risk that men
would not take to secure that which was worse than useless
for them, an enemy to steal away their brains. Several
days of continued routine of police, picket, drill and
other features of camp life follow, but entirely agreeable
after the exactions of May and June. Thursday, the
21st, the enemy varied the monotony by making an artillery
demonstration against Fort Sedgwick, possibly lest
its occupants should forget its nick name, "Hell." The
cordial relations existing on picket are well illustrated by
an incident related of the period where a Union soldier,
crawling out carefully to reach his station, was more than
surprised to hear in unmistakable Southern speech, the
words, "Say, you Yank don't belong thar'; that's we uns
place; you uns place's over thar," a bit of information
that the Yank did not hesitate to avail himself of. Deserters
are in constant evidence, all coming in ragged and
hungry.</p>

<p>It was at Fort Davis that Corporal Dow of Company C
got one of his first experiences on horseback. Captain
Hutchins sent him to Colonel Peirson, one morning, in
answer to the latter's request for a messenger to City
Point. On the Colonel's telling Dow that he was to ride

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">July 21, '64</span>

a horse to City Point, ten miles away, the poor Corporal
stood aghast and avowed his utter ignorance of an equine,
his vocation being that of a ship carpenter, saying, "I
can tell you all about a boat, Colonel, but I know absolutely
nothing about a horse." "Oh! That's nothing,"
replied the officer, "you can stick on and the horse you
will ride is like a rocking chair." The animal that Colonel
Peirson named was an exceedingly easy riding beast but,
unfortunately, the same had been appropriated by an
officer and ridden off on a somewhat questionable errand;
to make a fuss about it would be to give the officer away,
so Dow submitted to the caprice of the man in charge of
the stable and went off mounted on the Adjutant's steed,
notoriously the worst riding brute in the entire equine
outfit. John Gilpin's condition after his ride to Ware and
back was nothing compared to that of the Corporal when
he returned; as he expressed it, if he had ridden a rail the
entire twenty miles, with sledge hammers pounding the
ends of the same, he could not have been more jolted and
galled than he was at the end of his twenty miles. A
whiskey ration was being distributed when he reached
camp, and Dow remarked that he needed extensive application,
both within and without. "I guess I've killed
your horse or he has me," he remarked to the Adjutant as,
walking very wide, he passed that officer. "I hope you
have," said the officer, "for then I can get a better one."
The steed really did die from the trip, and when the
Colonel called for Dow again, luckily for him, the easy
going beast was ready.</p>

<p>Lest we should forget that we are in a state of war with
our Southern brethren, we are favored on the 24th and
the 25th, late in the afternoon, with certain iron compliments,
the rebels even shelling the picket line, a very
unusual procedure, one shell entering the fort; as many
of their missiles fail to explode, we conclude that they
must be using a very poor grade of powder. The cannon
opposite to us are manned by the Washington Artillery,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
that crack New Orleans organization whose batteries were
found in all the great Confederate armies, east and west.
Towards the end of the month, a greater degree of activity
is apparent; the Second Corps moves out on the 26th
and then returns the next day; on this same 27th, loads
of ammunition are bought up and picket relations are less
amicable than hitherto. We turn in July 29th, with
orders to turn out at 2.30 the next morning; this we do on
the 30th and the Fifth Corps moves a half mile or so to
our right into trenches back of the Ninth, with the Second
Corps similarly disposed at our right. As yet we do not
know what a large part of the country is to learn soon,
viz., that this 30th of July is to go down the annals of time
as the day of the "Crater." For weeks, under the direction
of Colonel Pleasants of the Forty-eighth Pennsylvania,
his men have been digging an underground way,
in front of Burnside's advanced lines, to a point beneath
Elliott's or Pegrams' Salient, more than five hundred feet
distant. It was finished on the 23rd and in it were soon
placed 8,000 lbs. of powder. To divert the attention of
the enemy, lest he might discover the undermining project,
the Second Corps had been sent across the James, to
assist the troops already there in a demonstration against
Richmond, but when the mine was ready for exploding
the corps was hastily called back. Pages have been written
of the event, of the explosion, of the advance of troops,
white and black, into the abyss caused by the eruption
and of their sorry fate beneath the concentrated fire of
the Confederates, under Mahone and his artillery, and the
unkind words that for many a year were uttered concerning
Burnside and his part in the well conceived though
unfortunately consummated project. Many of our Bay
State regiments are in the Ninth Corps and they perform
with credit whatever duty falls to their lot. We are not
called upon for any part in the fight, though we have our
share of earache at the terrific explosion and the artillery
firing afterwards. July ends with the Fifth Corps back in

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">July 29, '64</span>

the same position as that held before the "Crater" episode,
one of whose principal features was the practical demonstration
that negro troops are much like those of other complexion
and may be depended upon in an emergency.</p>

<p>Although August, 1864, is written deep in the hearts
and memories of members of the Thirty-ninth, up to
and beyond the middle of the month there is little to record
except the regular round of camp life close to the enemy's
lines, and the rumors that are ever afloat where many
are assembled. The sending away of the Sixth Corps
to the defense of Washington and the inauguration of
the Shenandoah Valley campaign under Sheridan, whose
only instructions, imparted to him by Grant at Monocacy,
in that meeting of August 6th, are "Go in," making matters
in the Petersburg Zone much more quiet than they would
be otherwise. A southside view of the situation is not
amiss and the words of T. N. Page, in his life of Lee, are
appended:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Jefferson Davis has declared that the remainder of the Petersburg
campaign is 'too sad to be patiently considered.' Locked
in his fortifications, with Richmond hung like a millstone about
his neck, while the South was cut off piecemeal from possibility
of contributing to his support, Lee, faithful to his trust, and
obedient to the laws, put aside whatever personal views he might
have held and continued to handle the situation with supreme
skill. Before that army had succumbed it had added to Grant's
casualty list, from the time he crossed the James, another sixty-odd
thousand men, thus doubling the ghastly record of his losses....
Grant seems to be the one firm, clear-headed, practical man in
all of the muddle of conflicting ambitions and confused orders.
'This man Grant grows on me,' Mr. Lincoln had said a year or
two before&mdash;'He fights.' It was the one solution of the problem&mdash;to
fight and keep on, no matter at what cost, till the other side
should be exhausted. Grant recognized it and acted on it. Happily
for the Union cause, Grant was the commanding general
of all of the armies of the Union. Unhappily for the Confederate
cause, Lee had not been given similar power. As dependent as
was the South on his genius, the military command was still
reserved in the hands of the civil authorities. He could not even
appoint his chief of staff."</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>Of the period between the Mine and the month of
March, 1865, General Humphreys, in his story of the campaign,
remarks on the movements of the Army of the Potomac
and that of the James to the right and the left, resulting
in the extension of our line of entrenchment in both
directions, and causing a corresponding extension of the
Confederate entrenchments on our left, and their occupation
in stronger force of their entrenchments on the north
bank of the James. Very likely these blazing, hot August
days would have been blazing with gunpowder in the
furthering of the investment of the Cockade City had
not the departure of the Sixth Corps compelled the temporary
suspension of the western project and a continuance of
the strengthening of the works already built. So far, however,
as anything akin to comfort beneath the midsummer
sun, in the exposed earthworks was concerned, nothing
of the sort was possible. Only when the king of day hid
his shining face, during the hours of night, could the intensity
of his heat be forgotten.</p>

<p>Still, time was passing, and every day marked the approach
of the wind-up, so long and so devoutly prayed
for. Regimental note takers were observing everything
out of the ordinary, and Horton of "E" remarks, August
1st on a visit to the scene of the explosion, July 30,
saying, "It is opposite the old brick house, where we were
before coming here" and he also comments on the burial
of the dead, while a flag of truce is up. Another, writing
on the 2d, says, "Walked along the front of our Corps,
everything is under ground, covered ways for teams and
troops to pass out if the enemy is near, showing a vast
amount of labor." Thursday, the 4th, was a Fast Day,
appointed by the President, which was observed in Fort
Davis by a suspension of fatigue duty and religious services
at 6.30 conducted by the chaplains of the Sixteenth
Maine, the One hundred and Fourth New York and the
One Hundred and Seventh Pennsylvania. The day was not
observed by all organizations, and along the line of the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">Aug. 4, '64</span>

Ninth Corps there was considerable firing. The versatile
accomplishments of Union soldiers are indicated in that on
the 5th of August a member of Company H, suffering from
toothache, sought out an ex-dentist in the One Hundred
and Seventh Pennsylvania and had his aching molars
filled; and the scarcity of proper material is also shown in
that the substance, used for filling, was just ordinary lead,
but it did the business. Who would suppose that, through
all of the ups-and-downs of an exacting campaign the
instruments, essential to such work would have been,
carried and what a substitute for a dentist's chair, with
its varied attachments, must have been the end of a log
or an empty cracker box!</p>

<p>Almost every day brings one or more deserters from the
rebel ranks, men who are convinced that the game is really
lost and can see no pleasure or profit in the "last ditch"
idea. They are invariably hungry, ragged and dirty.
On the 9th, Fred. Glines of "E," a Somerville boy, visits
the hospital of the Ninth Corps and there meets Professor
John P. Marshall, a respected instructor in Tufts College, a
most pleasant meeting for both parties. He also records
the blowing up of an ordnance boat, lying at the wharf in
City Point, receiving fixed ammunition. The incident is an
item in the history of the war, whereby there were a great
loss of life and destruction of property. All told, the value
of property destroyed mounted into the millions and the
number of lives lost was between sixty and seventy; one
hundred and thirty were wounded; some battles had a
smaller record. At the time the explosion was ascribed to
the careless handling of the ammunition cases.<a name="FNanchor_O_15" id="FNanchor_O_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_O_15" class="fnanchor">[O]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>In the night of the 10th-11th there was a little artillery
play in the direction of Fort Davis, but it proved to be
harmless. The 12th marks the second anniversary of the
muster-in of Company E, the first one in the Regiment.
This day also saw a new movement of the Second Corps
across the James River, another blow to be struck at Deep
Bottom, if practicable. Evidently Generals Grant and
Meade thought the quiet period had lasted long enough,
besides the Lieutenant General thought that the rebels
had sent off three of their divisions to reinforce Early in the
valley. The truth was that only Kershaw's had gone, and
all the others were right on the spot, ready to receive callers
or boarders, it was all the same thing, and the expedition
was not as productive of results as the projectors had
desired.</p>

<p>One scribe, on the 13th, writes, "Got paid off," and
elsewhere mention is made of the proximity of sutlers who
are ready to settle old scores and also to sell for cash.
Rumors of coming activity are current on the 14th and
the next day, Monday, the Brigade marched out of the fort
giving place to the First Division of the Ninth Corps,
negro troops, and going back about two miles, we pitch
camp and are evidently in reserve for some project. The
heavens also are active and the long delayed rain comes in
torrents for two hours in the afternoon. The troops which
relieved us were the colored division of the Ninth Corps,
under General Edward Ferrero, and of their appearance
as we marched out, Beck of Company C remarks, "Who
of the Thirty-ninth will ever forget the appearance of the
colored troops sent to relieve us, as they lay about outside,
half buried in yellow mud and water, as we filed out of the
fort on that rainy morning? They had been marching

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">Aug. 13, '64</span>

all night in the darkness, rain and mud, and were so completely
exhausted that sleep to them was the one great
necessity, position and bed being secondary. We carefully
stepped over their bodies and soon were beyond the sound
of their snoring." A heavy detail is made on the 16th for
work on Fort Sedgwick, but day work is impossible there on
account of the nearness of Fort Mahone, or "Damnation,"
whose sharpshooters are regularly gunning for the "blues."
The detail had hardly more than begun to work at 10 p. m.
when the command came to cease from labors and to report
to the Regiment at once. There the information is imparted
that the corps will move at 3 p. m. of the coming
day. On this next day, the 17th, when in line awaiting
the expected "Forward" there comes the order to break
ranks and encamp for the night. Concerning the movement
against the Weldon Railroad, whole volumes have
been written. It was a part of Grant's effort to cripple the
resources of the rebel army that was being hemmed in
gradually by the Union forces. The necessity of the move
had been recognized from the first and it had been delayed,
as already stated, principally by the departure of Sheridan
and the Sixth Corps to the Shenandoah Valley. We have
noted the activity of Hancock and his Second Corps, north
of the James, made in the hope that it might cause the
return of some of the Confederates who had gone to Early's
relief, thereby enabling Sheridan to strike a heavier blow in
his present command.</p>

<p>Incidentally, it seemed that troops had been withdrawn
from the rebel right to strengthen those fighting Hancock
and others, at the Confederate left, and Grant saw his
opportunity to strike again for the Weldon track, and this
is what he says in his Memoirs:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"From our left, near the old line, it was about three miles to
the Weldon Railroad. A division was ordered from the right of
the Petersburg line to reinforce Warren, while a division was
brought back from the north side of the James River to take its
place. The road was very important to the enemy. The limits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
from which his supplies had been drawn were already very much
contracted, and I knew that he must fight desperately to protect
it. Warren carried the road though with heavy loss on both
sides. He fortified his new position, and our trenches were then
extended from the left of our main line to connect with his new
one. Lee made repeated attempts to dislodge Warren's Corps,
but without success and with heavy loss. As soon as Warren was
fortified and reinforcement reached him, troops were sent south
to destroy the bridges on the Weldon Railroad, and with such
success that the enemy had to draw in wagons for a distance of
about thirty miles all the supplies they thereafter got from that
source. It was on the 21st that Lee seemed to have given up the
Weldon Railroad as having been lost to him; but along about the
24th or 25th he made renewed attempts to recapture it. Again
he failed, and with very heavy losses to him as compared with
ours. On the night of the 20th, our troops on the north side of
the James were withdrawn, and Hancock and Gregg were sent
south to destroy the Weldon Railroad. They were attacked on
the 25th, at Reams Station, and after desperate fighting a part of
our line gave way, losing five pieces of artillery. But the Weldon
Railroad never went out of our possession from the 18th of August
to the close of the war."</p></div>

<p>The foregoing extract from the memoirs of the Lieutenant
General has been made as an indication of his opinion of
the magnitude of the work of August 18th in the progress of
the war. The Army and Navy Journal of August 27th,
after noting the extraordinary storm of the 15th, "Which
swept away many tents and sutler's booths and filled the
trenches with water" and the fierce cannonading on the
16th, also that of 1 a. m. of the 18th, lasting for two hours,
has this to offer concerning the event which figures so
largely in the annals of our Regiment:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"At four o'clock, on the morning of Thursday, the 18th, and
shortly after the heavy cannonading ceased, the Fifth Corps
started from its camp (which was rather in reserve) with four days'
rations, towards the Weldon Railroad. It took some time to get
across the ground formerly held by the Second and Sixth Corps.
Then the column marched towards Ream's Station, driving in
easily the enemy's skirmishers, of whom a part were captured.
Between seven and eight o'clock, the advance arrived at Six
Mile Station, and busily setting to work, a mile of the track was

<span class="sidenote smcap">Aug. 18, '64</span>

torn up and burned, and the rails destroyed in the usual manner.
The skirmishing up to this time had been very light, the enemy
having obviously withdrawn to his left, and the whole move being
made with hardly a show of opposition. While the First Division
was tearing up the track, the others passed on towards Petersburg
and after advancing two or three miles, took position so as to repel
an expected attack from the enemy. They did not have long to
wait. About noon, Walker's Virginia and Davis' Mississippi
brigades came hurrying down the railroad. Ayres' Second Division
was stationed at this point; the Third and Fourth Divisions,
at his right; and the First on his left. The battle opened very
promptly on the arrival of the enemy with sharp artillery firing.
The enemy, a part of Hill's Corps, then rushed in with great impetuosity,
falling with most force upon Hayes', Lyle's and Cutler's
brigades, and succeeding in flanking a portion of our force,
including Lyle's First Brigade, Crawford's Third Division, the
latter brigade being brought forward under a severe enfilading
fire. For two hours the firing was very hot, and as it was an open
fight the losses were heavy. The main battle lasted till about
three o'clock; but the skirmishing and cannonading continued
till night, when both forces went to entrenching, the possession
of the railroad still being left to our troops. Our loss is still somewhat
uncertain, but it is somewhere from five hundred to one
thousand. The Second and Third Divisions suffered most and
the Thirty-ninth Massachusetts and the Fifteenth New York
Heavy Artillery lost heavily. The enemy claims to have captured
eight officers and one hundred and fifty men from us in this
fight. The enemy's loss in killed and wounded was probably
nearly equal to ours, but he lost few prisoners.</p>

<p>Headquarters at night were at the Six Mile House, so called
from its distance from Petersburg. That night and all the next
day our forces were busily engaged in strengthening our lines,
and in endeavoring to connect the right of the new position with
the left of our old line. But towards the evening of Friday the
enemy came out in force and pushed in between the new entrenchment
and the old ones, flanking the Fifth Corps and sweeping off
about fifteen hundred prisoners. The Ninth Corps arriving on
the field of battle, checked the enemy. Our loss was about three
thousand men. Saturday was comparatively quiet, but on
Sunday the enemy again furiously attacked us, and was repulsed
with heavy loss. On Monday and Tuesday, there was occasional
firing along the centre, but our lines were otherwise undisturbed.
Our forces still hold the Weldon railroad, the capture and re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>tention
of which have cost a week of the hardest fighting of the
campaign."</p></div>

<p>General Humphreys, in his "Virginia, Campaign of '64
and '65," has the following version of the story that
specially touches our Division and Brigade:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"General A. P. Hill, with Davis' and Walker's brigades under
General Heth, and Weisiger's, Colquitt's and Clingman's under
General Mahone, with Lee's cavalry and Pegram's batteries,
moved to the Vaughan Road intersection. Heth was to attack
Ayers, while Mahone, familiar with the woods, was to move concealed
by it some distance beyond Crawford's right, break
through Bragg's skirmish line, and take Bragg and Crawford in
rear. About half past four in the afternoon, General Mahone
with his command formed in columns of fours, broke through
Bragg's skirmish line, faced to the right, and swept rapidly down
toward General Warren's right flank, taking all Crawford's
skirmish line and part of his line of battle in rear. His skirmish
line fell back in the greatest confusion, and in doing so, masked
the fire of his line of battle, and forced it to fall back, together
with a part of General Ayres' division. Heth at the same time
opened on Ayres' centre and left. General Warren, reforming
the parts of Ayers' and Crawford's divisions that were broken,
brought them forward again and regained the ground temporarily
lost, taking some prisoners and two flags. General Willcox was
ordered up to attack; and White's division (Ninth Corps) was
formed facing to the right, and engaging Colquitt's brigade
drove it back, and captured some prisoners. Mahone's command
fell back rapidly in great confusion to their intrenchments, carrying
with them the parts of Warren's command disorganized by
the attack on their rear in the woods, and a large portion of the
pickets."</p></div>

<p>As an illustration of one man's appreciation of a great
battle, of what he sees, the following extract is taken from
the journal of Lieutenant Dusseault:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"We turned out at 3 a. m. This was the day of the 'Battle
of Weldon Railroad,' sometimes called that of the 'Six Mile
House' or the 'Globe Tavern,' also 'Yellow House.' We began
our march at five o'clock towards the railroad, southwest and
towards our left, a distance of five or six miles to the 'Six Mile
House,' it being just that distance from Petersburg. Here we
found the rebel pickets and drove them before us. General

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">Aug. 18, '64</span>

Crawford's Division (Third), to which our Regiment belonged,
formed a line of battle on the right of the railroad, and General
Ayers of our Second Division formed on the left of the road.
General Griffin's First Division was in the rear, tearing up the
tracks as we thus advanced towards Petersburg. We had proceeded
about a mile and a half in dense woods, when Hill's
Rebel Corps charged us. The 'Six Mile House' is now behind us,
Ayers' Division gives way, letting the enemy in on our left flank.
There is nothing for us to do but fall back or be captured. The
rebel line in front of us is within forty feet. The order is given to
fall back. All were lying down flat on the ground at the time,
the enemy in the same position, but ready to shoot as fast as we
stood up. Colonel C. L. Peirson was already badly wounded in
the bowels by a minie ball. He was able to stand long enough to
give the command and then he fell. Just as I rose, a bullet struck
me in the right side, broke the eighth rib and entered the lower
lobe of the lung. I was taken off the field, along with the Colonel,
to the field hospital just back of us. Sergeant Bradshaw, afterwards
second lieutenant, and Private Thomas, both of Company
H, were leading me and while thus supporting me, the latter was
shot in the wrist, in consequence of which, hesitating a moment,
he was captured. For a time I occupied the next cot to the Colonel's.
I heard the surgeon say that he could not live twenty-four
hours. As I remember, he was placed outside in a tent by
himself to die. Three or four hours later, when the surgeons
looked in upon him they saw that he had revived somewhat, and
he was taken to the division hospital. His life was long
despaired of. Few men recovered from wounds of like character
received during the Civil War. As Major Tremlett was still
absent, the command devolved on Capt. F. R. Kingsley of Company
E. Our side was beaten for a time but, after being driven
about a quarter of a mile, the men reformed and held the foe."</p></div>

<p>Fred. Baker of Company H had joined the Regiment as a
recruit in February, 1864; he was on the skirmish line on
August 18th, and, the position being a pretty warm one,
he had been digging a pit to get into for cover. About the
time that the hole had become large enough for him to get
into it, some rebel shot and killed him. He fell into the pit
and some of the others covered him with the earth which
he had removed. He had dug his own grave.</p>

<p>Dexter Gray of Company E, who had been a schoolmaster
before the war, was shot in the head; he was so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
paralyzed that he could neither speak nor move. His
comrades were preparing to bury him, thinking him dead.
He knew everything that was being done but he could
make no sign to them, neither could he help himself in the
least. But just before they were ready to bury him, he
recovered sufficiently to make them understand, and the
burial was postponed for about twenty years.</p>

<p>Many years later, General Peirson, having been requested
to give some personal reminiscences to the Salem
Evening News, under what he calls his last battle, recites
the story of his experience in the foregoing 18th of August.
After some prefatory statements, the General proceeds:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"General Grant's movements in that campaign were successively
to the left, and the order soon came for us to move to the left
until we crossed the Weldon Railroad, which was about the last
remaining feeder for the secession troops around Petersburg and
Richmond. Arriving there we began tearing up the rails for half
a mile to pile up the dry sleepers and put the iron rails on top of
the cobpile and then firing the sleepers, the rails by the heat and
their own weight were rendered worthless."<a name="FNanchor_P_16" id="FNanchor_P_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_P_16" class="fnanchor">[P]</a></p>

<p>"Moving through small trees, we came upon the enemy, who
immediately attacked. Our men were ordered to lie down, and
to receive and return the fire from their position. The commander
cannot avail himself of such protection, since the men are likely
to be less homesick if they see him apparently indifferent. Notwithstanding
these precautions, there were soon wounded men in
plenty, the colonel being shot through the body, falling at once
upon his knees from the shock. Just at that moment one of the
lieutenants, Severand, from the left company of the Regiment
came up and reported, 'Everything is swept away from the left.'
He was ordered to go out to the left and investigate. He never
returned. I went then to that company and sent out the captain
to make the same investigation. He did not return. I then went
out myself, and meeting a secession soldier, remarked with some

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">Aug. 18, '64</span>

force, 'Drop that gun and come in here.' He obeyed, not understanding
that I had no strength to compel him, and I learned
from him that his troops had got behind our left flank. This
view was soon confirmed by the direction from which the bullets
came. I then gave orders, something like this, 'Fours, right
about, forward on the left company, March' or words to that
effect, and the situation was saved.</p>

<p>"By that time, I was so much exhausted by the loss of blood that
I was carried to the rear, where there was a field hospital. When
I met the regimental surgeon who was my dear friend, I saw tears
come into his previously cheerful face, and I then knew that
something serious had happened. They gave me a little tent
and some of the wounded officers came to bid me good-bye. The
major general, commanding the division, hearing that one of his
colonels had come to grief, sent an aide to inquire what could be
done for my comfort. From him I obtained an ambulance. Our
chaplain went with me, also a wounded soldier, who died on the
way, and we started for City Point, where were the main hospitals
of the army. In a few miles we came to a field hospital, where I
hoped to be allowed to remain, but the surgeon declined, I thought
brutally, to receive me, though I afterwards learned that any
other course would have been fatal to me. So we proceeded on our
long journey. Arriving at the splendidly equipped hospitals at
City Point, my wound was examined, the ball probed for, and
found, and by an operation extracted. Inflammation had by this
time set in, and I remained in a very dangerous state for many
days.</p>

<p>"While I thus lay on my cot, the hospital was visited by some
well meaning but clumsy Christians, whose mission it was to
supply the patients with testaments and tracts. They, seeing me,
stopped to urge me, since I was so soon to meet my Creator, to
turn from my evil ways while there was yet time, and to read the
instructive words with which they burdened my couch. One of
my friends afterwards said, though I cannot vouch for the truth
of the story, that I had only strength enough to reply, 'Go to
blazes.' However, I grew better slowly, was sent North on a
stretcher, and put to bed in Barton Square, where my dear mother
nursed me back to life. Some months after, when the war had
closed, I went into business on Kilby street, Boston. One day there
came into my office a well remembered soldier who proved to be
the captain of the left company. He gave the military salute,
and remarked, 'Colonel, I have come to report what I found on
the left.' It seems that coming upon a secession picket, they had
captured him, taken his weapons with most of his clothes, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
persuaded him to go through a course of southern prisons from
which he had only just returned."</p></div>

<p>Of the 19th, Lieutenant Dusseault has this to say, "The
fight was resumed. The rebels found a gap on our right
and came through, thus flanking us again. Our artillery
opened on them as they were between us and artillery,
and the shells did us as much harm as they did the enemy.
The men of both sides were now pretty well mixed up in
the woods. Whichever squad was the larger would capture
the other. This day our Regiment was in the worst part of
the line and suffered more than any other, unless it was
the Sixteenth Maine, which was captured almost to a man."</p>

<p>In a paper read before the Massachusetts Military
Historical Society, December 13, 1880, Captain Charles
H. Porter says of this day:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The morning opened dull and rainy, with the troops in good
spirits. No changes were made. The troops of their own accord
strengthened the field works, making them quite strong. Nothing
happened until about 3 a. m., when the enemy showed considerable
activity, the pickets firing and showing quite a bold front.
General Lee, determining to drive us from the road sends two
divisions under Heth and Mahone. The former has four brigades
with eight pieces of artillery from Pegram's battalion. Six of
the pieces are west of the railroad and two are east of the same.
Mahone has Weisiger's, Colquitt's and a part of Clingman's
brigades. Mahone has discovered that the right of the Fifth
Corps does not connect with anything. The Ninth Corps, which
has been ordered to fill the gap, has not yet reached its destination
though it is two o'clock p. m. Doubtless the extremely wet day
prevented the prompt arrival of the reinforcement. Our troops,
finding everything quiet and not expecting an attack, disposed
of themselves in every way, trying to keep as dry as possible,
little thinking of the fate in store for them. Four o'clock was the
hour agreed upon by Heth and Mahone, as the time when the
flanking column should be in position and almost to the minute,
Mahone's troops reached our skirmish line and drove it in. Then
turning in the thick woods to the west, they moved in column
directly upon the exposed right flank of the Federals. This
exposed flank had been a subject of anxiety to General Warren,
and he had issued orders accordingly.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">Aug. 19, '64</span>

"While the Third Division was passing a quiet afternoon, the
officers at headquarters were informed that Heth was attacking
vigorously in front, this being principally against the Second Division.
Our Third Division is still undisturbed. The butchers of
the division are slaughtering cattle when the pickets of the Ninth
Corps come tumbling in, saying that the enemy is advancing
upon them. The woods are so very dense that nothing can be
seen through them. Not even General Warren, himself, can
discern anything. When, however, a line of men is discovered
approaching, Warren is so sure that they are the delayed Ninth
Corps contingent, he will not allow artillery to open on them, a
very serious error on his part, for they are soon discovered to be
a portion of the flanking Confederates, and that a considerable
part of them is between our artillery and the Third Division. Our
artillerists spring to their guns at once and open a rapid fire
upon them. How does this act bear upon our Third Division,
where the Thirty-ninth Regiment is? The very first intimation
that Crawford's men have that all is not well with them, is the
bursting of spherical case from the rear, in their midst. They are
aware that the artillery is massed behind them, and they realize
that something must have happened to bring such firing from
their own comrades. Now, the firing in front from Heth and his
men begins again, and our pickets are again attacked. It becomes
necessary to seek protection from our own thirty guns. The men
spring over the breastworks and hold them in reverse, thinking
the pickets able to check the attack in front, and that their chief
danger is from the rear. The suspense is soon broken when a line
of confederate infantry comes rushing in upon them. All is now
confusion. Without leaders, the men are completely demoralized.
In the dark and dismal woods, dismayed by the fire from our
own guns, the men make but a short resistance and this flanking
column under Mahone captures nearly two brigades of the Third
Division. The attack of Heth in front continues, adding to the
confusion, but the rapid firing of our artillery convinces the enemy
that there is nothing more for them in that direction, so they content
themselves with the 2700 prisoners, whom they have swept
almost entirely from the Third Division, and move up the Halifax
road with more captives than they themselves number. As they
thus move away the captured men narrowly escape the fire of
Mahone's two cannon stationed on the east side of the railroad;
the gunners think so large an array of men in blue must be an
attacking party, but the condition is disclosed soon enough to
prevent the possible slaughter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>"Such men of the Third Division as have not been captured,
seek safety in every direction, each man for himself. Dodging
behind trees, now east, now west, some of the wrecked body of
men get the true direction and come out at the edge of the clearing,
looking towards our artillery. Here they behold a welcome
sight. It is an advancing line of the Ninth Corps, responding to
the evident need. It is the First Division of the Ninth Corps,
composed largely of Massachusetts men, and they are friends
indeed. We know that, having the situation well in hand, the
position will be regained and the railroad held. The remnants
of the Third Division are finally rallied near the Dunlock House.
Picture, if you can, one little knot gathered together, about
twenty-five in number, all that, at this time, can be assembled
of a regiment that yesterday carried three hundred and fifty
muskets into the first day's fight, whose commander was most
grievously wounded on that day. They are soon marshaled to
occupy, as far as they can, their old line of works. Very few sleep
any during the night, as the weary hours roll on, and it seems as
though daylight would never come to bring relief to the dread
hanging over the command through the night. Mahone and his
men retire to their defenses with feelings quite the reverse of those
of their opponents and the 'Little Gamecock of the Confederacy'
fully merits his appellation as he turns over his plunder to General
Lee."</p></div>

<p>An excellent personal story of the second day is told
by Sergt. George E. Fowle, Company K, whose experience
quite likely was similar to that of nearly all the men of the
Regiment who succeeded in getting out of the confusion,
free:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I was acting First Sergeant of Company K. Corporal S. A.
McFeeley was my bunkmate, and was one of the color guard.
We were stationed in the woods on the right of the railroad, where
the rebels made vigorous demonstrations on our front while a
large force turned our right flank. Our artillery was firing solid
shot over our heads when the enemy broke through and came
between us and our cannon. The guns were immediately depressed
to reach the confederates and the shots coming through
them and reaching us were the first intimation we had of anything
wrong. McFeeley was sent back to stop the artillery and was
captured. The line was doubled up as the enemy came down on
our flank. I started back with the rest and came across a canteen
with the string cut; picking it up, I took a drink and filled my own

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">Aug. 19. '64</span>

canteen, but when this was done I found myself alone, but I
followed along in the direction which the others had gone. I
came to a cart path, where I saw some of our men with a few Johnnies
on the other side of the path. The bushes separating us
were so thick and low that I had to spread them apart with my
hands to get through, and when I did and straightened up, with
my gun in my hand, I found myself looking into a rebel gun barrel,
held by a Johnnie who was standing by the side of an officer,
whom I took to be a colonel. I was told to throw down the gun,
which I did and walked across the road where the officer took me
by the shoulder and turned me around, saying, 'Get into the
ranks, and we'll take good care of you.' There were so many
prisoners that we were in all sorts of position, one, two and three
deep. The man nearest me wanted to know where the Maryland
Brigade was located.</p>

<p>"I unhitched my knapsack and turned around to see if anybody
was looking, and gave it a throw into the bushes. As I did so,
I saw Joe Adams, the National color bearer, come out into the
road, look up and down the same, and then he raised the colors
over his head and threw them into the wheel-ruts, there happened
to be a break in the guards near him. I threw off my scabbard
and cut the strap which held my cartridge box. We were nearing
the railroad tracks, where the rebels turned and marched up towards
Petersburg. When I saw a good chance I jumped into the
bushes and soon heard someone behind me, and turning saw Joe,
Adams and another man. All this time we were getting more or
less missiles from our own guns; the solid shot had been changed
to shells and we were troubled quite as much as the confederates.
We soon encountered a rebel with a gun in his hand, just as a shell
exploded near our heads. To Adams' query as to where was the
direction of the rebel rear, he replied, 'I'll be d&mdash;d if I know.'
At this, I left them to see what I could do for myself in finding
our own breastworks. In a short time I came across a lieutenant
of the Sixteenth Maine, who was behind a tree, whereupon I
found a tree also, but I didn't stop long, since I was not gaining
ground. We could see the prisoners and the guard and occasionally
a rebel would come our way.</p>

<p>"I started back towards our works, but on arriving found no one
there, so I sallied forth to where the right of the Regiment had been.
Going some distance beyond where our right was, I saw some troops
mount the breastworks. At first I couldn't make out who they
were, blue or gray, but, stooping down, I found them to be our
men, and I recognized Corporal Abijah Thompson, who beckoned
me to come up his way. The ground was covered with muskets,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
which had been thrown down when the boys were captured.
Colonel Wheelock of the Ninety-seventh New York, then commanding
his brigade, was up on the right, and seeing the movement,
he put his men in front of the works and charged out upon
the enemy, capturing everything in sight, Yank and Reb, including
the Colonel, who was going to take good care of me, a
stand of confederate colors and, best of all, our own which Adams
had thrown down.<a name="FNanchor_Q_17" id="FNanchor_Q_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_Q_17" class="fnanchor">[Q]</a> The state colors borne by Serg. William A.
Mentzer of "A" were brought in safely by him, though by great
effort.</p>

<p>"On getting out of the woods into the field, there stood the First
Division of the Ninth Corps in line; I ran down and told General
White that the rebels had got our Brigade, and that they were on
the road in there, not ten rods from where he sat on his horse,
and he could get them all if he went in. The General turned
around and said to one of his staff, 'They have got the road we
came down.' He was waiting for orders from General Warren.
It had been raining and I didn't know whether the gun that I had
picked up would go off or not, so I pointed the muzzle towards
the ground and fired. Whereupon the General said, 'Don't you
know any better than that?' I went back to the line, borrowed
some cartridges and caps and loaded the gun, when Colonel
Lyle and the remnant of the Brigade came out of the bushes.
His command resembled a color guard. A staff officer soon
ordered me back into the breastworks. I picked up a sergeant's
knapsack and soon made a set of sergeant's chevrons. Our company
made two stacks of guns that night, and I put my gun across
the stacks, and was in command of the company. Lieutenant
Tidd and twenty-seven men of Company K were taken prisoners.
Our captain was sick and had been taken to the hospital."</p></div>

<span class="sidenote smcap">Aug. 20, '64</span>

Of Saturday, the 20th, Captain Porter remarks that it
opened quite pleasantly and that the sunlight, struggling
through the clouds, was cheering to the lonely feeling
troops of the Third Division, those that remained in line.
The Ninth Corps had made a complete connection with the
right of our division and further danger in this direction
was obviated. This day the engineers of the Fifth
Corps marked out a new line of works to be occupied in the
open, just in advance of the Dunlock House, about three
hundred yards north from the Six Mile House. This line
ran near the woods in which so great disaster had befallen
our troops. Our Third division occupied ground to the
right, east of the railroad, which still divided the forces of
the Second Division. The breastworks were heavily made
and were quite impracticable for an assault in front. The
lines of the Fifth and Ninth Corps were continuations of
each other. All lines in advance of this new one were
abandoned in the afternoon and evening of the 20th.
While there was hard work in the trenches there was no
engagement with the enemy. The latter had by no means
given up the recovery of the railroad and was making
plans for the morrow. The juncture of the Fifth and
Ninth Corps, leaving no aperture in that direction, his
attention was necessarily drawn towards the left. It was
said that General Roger A. Pryor of Virginia, conspicuous
in ante-bellum days, by his altercation with John F.
Potter, a fellow Congressman from Wisconsin, who named
bowie knives as duelling weapons, having retired from
active army service, in his capacity of independent scout,
had climbed a tree and from this outlook discovered, as he
thought, the vulnerableness of the Union left. Hastening
to impart his discovery to General Mahone, the latter made
plans for an attack on the 21st. With the details of this
unsuccessful effort to repeat the tactics of the 19th, we have
no especial concern, except to state that this time, Mahone
carried back no prisoners and reported no victory. Ayers
and his First Division were quite ready to receive callers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>Of this campaign of four days, General Warren says,
"The heat of the first day (18th) was excessive, and on the
march many fell out who are here reported among the
missing, but who will soon rejoin us. About fifty were
completely prostrated by sunstroke. The men were kept
working night and day, and every day were wet through
with the rains. The side roads and fields were almost
impassable for artillery." However much the Confederates
may have lamented the loss of the Weldon Railroad as a
supply source, and to them it was a grievous one, the conditions
brought about by these terrible battle days in
August remained unchanged to the end. Grant was
taking no backward steps and with the grip of a bulldog,
whatever he grasped, he held.</p>

<p>The losses met by the Thirty-ninth were frightful. May
4th, when the Regiment crossed the Rapidan there were
five hundred and thirty men in the ranks, fully twice the
number in any other two regiments in the Brigade. Since
then we had received from the Twelfth and Thirteenth
Regiments two hundred and twenty-eight transfers, bringing
the aggregate to nearly eight hundred men, yet so
severe had been the tests of the Wilderness, Spottsylvania
and the attacks on Petersburg, including this most recent
calamity on the Weldon Railroad, on the morning of
August 22d only one hundred and two enlisted men and
nine officers reported for duty. Of course, some would
eventually report from the missing, which included not
alone prisoners and wounded, but stragglers as well, still
the fact remained that the swoop that Malone made upon
the First Brigade on that August afternoon came near
finishing it. Colonel Peirson was seriously wounded and
in hospital; Major Tremlett was away on detached service;
Captain F. R. Kinsley was a prisoner in the hands of the
enemy and the command devolved upon Captain George
S. Nelson of Company A. We have already seen that
Company K stacked nine muskets, under command of a
sergeant, the night of the 19th; ten men were reported

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">Aug. 22, '64</span>

left in Company C, and "E" Company had only seven
or eight of the original number. Terrible are the ravages
of war.</p>

<p>The several army corps along the southside of Petersburg
are hereafter to gradually strengthen the lines already
established, to build new forts and to place the Weldon
Railroad in a condition that even its recovery would in
no way profit the Confederacy, since the impoverished
condition of the latter would be quite incapable of putting
it into a running condition. Colonel T. F. McCoy of the
Hundred and Seventh Pennsylvania, commanding the
Brigade after the retirement of Colonel Lyle, accounts for
the procedure of the First Brigade during these days. He
says that the dead were buried on the 22d. On the 23rd
the division under General Crawford engaged in destroying
the railroad from the Yellow House in the direction
of Petersburg, the First Brigade, however, acting as a
reserve to protect the working parties. The 24th, what
was left of the brigade rested quietly in camp. The 25th
brought orders to change camps, in doing which, however,
other orders were received to prepare for action, and the
column immediately took up the line of march towards
Reams' Station, where the Second Corps was heavily engaged
with a large force of the enemy. It was at this
point that Colonel Peter Lyle, Ninetieth Pennsylvania,
who had commanded the Brigade so long, on account of
severe illness, was obliged to relinquish his command.
Colonel McCoy,<a name="FNanchor_R_18" id="FNanchor_R_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_R_18" class="fnanchor">[R]</a> succeeding, marched the Brigade to the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>

Yellow House, where he received orders from General
Crawford to report with his command to General Bragg,
which he did, and proceeded in the direction of Reams,
but after marching about one mile he was ordered to countermarch
and encamp for the night. Next day, 26th, camp
was again changed and the men were ordered to throw
up works, southeast of the Yellow House.</p>

<p>The digging that the Fifth Corps did in the vicinity of
the Yellow House became a part of the system of fortifications
that were gradually extended to Fort Fisher, the
extreme western fort, where there was a turn or refusal
of the line to the southward, lest the favorite maneuver
of the rebels might be tried on the Union left. Day and
night, the work progressed, every day strengthening the
coils which Grant and Meade were casting about the
doomed city, and every one knew that the fall of Petersburg
meant the end of Richmond also. A deal of ammunition
was wasted in the bombardment of Petersburg, yet
it had to be kept up, or the enemy would have thought the
Yankees quite inefficient. They grew almost indifferent
to the missiles from the Union guns and fifty years later
they will tell of the tons of ammunition that were wasted
upon them and their city. The "Petersburg Express"<a name="FNanchor_S_19" id="FNanchor_S_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_S_19" class="fnanchor">[S]</a>
located near the Friend House, and manned by the First

<span class="sidenote smcap">Sept. 2, '64</span>

Connecticut Heavy Artillery, failed not in its two hundred
pound compliments for weeks and months and in the
Twentieth Century the mortar itself will form a principal
part of the regimental monument in Hartford. Somehow
there is more real fighting over on the other side of the
James where the Tenth Corps is located and the enemy
cannot dispossess themselves of the impression that the
Yankees really mean to get into Richmond that way.</p>

<p>By the last of the month, matters have resolved themselves
into a long steady round of fatigue and picket duty
to the music of artillery along the entire line, the attitude
of the opposing guardsmen on duty depending entirely on
the agreements that they may have made with each other.
September 2d, General D. McM. Gregg, supported by
General Crawford's (Third) Division of the Fifth Corps
started out on an errand of some sort up the Vaughn road,
towards the Plank Road and Petersburg; in other words
it was a case of marching up the hill and then marching
down again, for finding the enemy strongly entrenched,
the entire force returned to camp. This day also the foe
forgot the tacit agreement of friendliness and opened up
a fire of musketry along the entire line, killing a large number
of men and effectually ending amicable relations for
some time.</p>

<p>While the fact of the occupation of Atlanta by the
Union forces had been understood as early as the 2d, no
official notice of the success was taken until the 4th,
Sunday, when one hundred shotted guns were fired from
extreme right to the furthest left, the celebration lasting
about an hour, the enemy thinking it so queer a way of
observing the Lord's day that they, too, opened their
batteries and added to the din, arising from their own
misfortune. "Westward Ho!" is evidently still the watchword
of our commander, for every effort is made to strengthen
the extreme left, and both sides watch out with the
utmost alertness. For the sake of rearranging a portion
of our line of works it became necessary to gain possession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
of the rebel rifle pits at "The Chimneys," on the Jerusalem
Plank Road, and General Mott, with a backing from the
Second Corps, was directed to accomplish the task, this
on the night of the 9th of September. The duty was done
at the point of the bayonet and the works were immediately
reversed, the same becoming of great advantage to
the new possessors, General Walker of the Second Corps
pronouncing the operation one of the most creditable in
the entire siege. Of course, the foe did not let go without
protest, and subsequent nights were rendered lurid by
his efforts to regain the lost ground, but to no avail.</p>

<p>The thoroughness with which the campaign is advancing
appears on Sunday, the 11th, when an engine is run
over the newly laid railroad from City Point to the Weldon
road at Yellow House. The Confederates are running
trains to Stony Creek, twelve miles south of Reams; and
the remainder of the distance, around the Union left into
Petersburg, is effected by wagon, pretty slow and vexatious
work! The firing along the picket line, annoying
and useless, had become very obnoxious to General Birney
of the Tenth Corps at the Union right, and to give the
enemy something to think about opened a heavy fire on
the works in his front and on Petersburg itself. The
enemy also played during the afternoon on certain signal
towers along the front of the Eighteenth Corps. A very
tranquil evening followed this ebulition. Perhaps no event
of the week gave the Confederates so much pleasure as
their success in surprising a couple of cavalry regiments
in charge of a large number of beef cattle, some 2500 in
number, near Coggin's Point on the James River and
running the vast herd into their lines and taking with
them the careless guards. While the rebels were thus
supplying their commissariat, others of their number made
an attack on the entire skirmish line of the Fifth Corps
and capture nearly a hundred of the men. On the 16th,
the Second Brigade was assigned to forts on the left of
the line, the Thirty-ninth being ordered to Fort Duchesne.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">Sept. 16, '64</span>

Camp was pitched just outside the fort, along with the
One Hundred and Fourth New York the Eleventh, Forty-eighth
and Ninety-eighth Pennsylvania, all under the command
of Colonel Richard Coulter of the last named regiment.
The 19th was enlivened by telegraphic news of
Sheridan's victory near Winchester where Early was sent
"Whirling up the Valley," followed by salvos of artillery
in honor thereof. On the 28th, the paymaster left six
months' pay.</p>

<p>Ten days later, Thursday, the 29th, was a counterpart
to a deal of activity on the Union right, when business
was actually suspended in Richmond through fear that
an assault was imminent; a column consisting of Gregg's
cavalry, supported by two infantry brigades, set out
towards the Poplar Springs Church road, beyond the
Vaughan turnpike, advancing about two miles. On their
return, they were attacked by Hampton's cavalry, the
force that had stolen the cattle-herd, and a brisk encounter
followed. Friday, the 30th, extending into Saturday,
took place the battle of Peebles' farm between certain
portions of the Fifth and Ninth Corps and the Confederates,
General Grant having in mind a movement towards the
Southside Railroad, expecting thus to still further cripple
the cities of Petersburg and Richmond, the result being
a considerable advance westward of the Union left. While
all of this commotion was taking place, the Thirty-ninth
Regiment moved into the fort, remaining there until the
16th of October, when it came out and took a position on
the Weldon Railroad half a mile in front of Fort Duchesne,
and a mile from the Globe Tavern or Yellow House.</p>

<p>So far as our Regiment is concerned, affairs are very
quiet, though the extended Union line towards the west
affords opportunity for constant work, day and night, for
every man, and the number in the Thirty-ninth is not very
great, so large a portion of the survivors of the Regiment
being involuntary boarders in the Confederacy. The
fact that less than eleven months remain of the service for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
which the men enlisted causes not a few remarks as to the
gradual approach of the day of release, though all must
know that the future holds many possibilities of battles
and other exposure. Ignorance in this case is surely bliss.
The first third of October covers considerable activity
on the Union right, where Darbytown Road wins a place
in battle lists, and the cooler nights indicate the approach
of another winter with its peculiar exactions. The first
frost comes on the night of the 9th-10th. From the 8th
to the 11th all sorts of firing have been common in the
vicinity of Sedgwick or "Fort Hell" in local parlance, on
the last named night the pyrotechny being especially
brilliant, a Richmond paper stating that it was the heaviest
mortar shelling of the siege, "The heavens being ablaze
with brilliant meteors, ascending, descending and shooting
athwart the horizon in almost countless numbers and
unsurpassed beauty."</p>

<p>During these early October days, General S. W. Crawford
is in command of the Fifth Corps and with it, accompanying
the Ninth Corps, a reconnoisance in force is made
on the 8th towards the Union left, possibly with an idea
of extending our works even beyond Fort McRae. After
a day of hard marching and constant skirmishing the
troops returned, wearied enough, to their starting point;
but General Grant is not satisfied, even yet, that he cannot
reach the Southside Railroad. A little past the middle of
the month, or on the 19th, comes the most unqualified
report of victory in the Shenandoah Valley that the country
has yet heard. It is the story of Cedar Creek, fought on
the 19th, when differing from the dispatches after Winchester,
just a month before, where Early was sent "whirling
up the valley"; so nearly annihilated is the rebel army,
it would be a very stiff breeze which could find anything
left to whirl. The activities for this month, as far as the
Fifth Corps is concerned, terminated with the joint move,
on the 26th, of the Second, Fifth and Ninth Corps along
with Gregg's Cavalry against the Southside Railroad,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">Oct. 26, '64</span>

known as the Boydton Plank Road, some distance east
of the railroad. Very full and explicit instructions had
been issued to the designated troops, and the utmost care
had been taken to insure the safety of the entrenchments
during the movement. The Fifth Corps, or that part of
it in the project, marched out on the Squirrel Level Road,
in a southwesterly direction towards Hatcher's Run, a
small stream rising near Sutherland Station on the Southside
Road and flowing southeastwardly into Rowanty
Creek, a tributary of the Nottoway River. The Lieutenant
General was determined to leave no stone unturned to
secure the longed-for source of Petersburg's supplies.
The country itself revealed many of the Wilderness characteristics,
there being no roads and no chances to move
artillery. In this confusion, the right of the Second Corps,
furthest west, was lost to the Fifth Corps, a fact which
enabled the enemy to get in between the two corps and
capture a considerable number of men, the Second Corps
suffering more than the Fifth, one whole regiment being
run in. The mix-up was not unlike that of the 18th of
August, for rain set in and ammunition was scarce, our
leaders were ignorant of the lay of the land which the
enemy seemed to know perfectly; so the left flank movement
ended with the return of the troops to their former
positions. On this same 26th the Thirty-ninth moved
to the left and garrisoned Fort Canahey.</p>

<p>A very good story of give and take is recorded of this
week; at dusk in the evening of Thursday, the 27th, one
hundred volunteers of the One Hundred and Forty-eighth
Pennsylvania attacked the fort of the enemy which succeeded
that blown up on the 30th of July, climbed the parapet,
drove the occupants out and, for a brief period, were
masters of the situation, this being a plan to hold the
attention of the Confederates while the assault was progressing
further to left, but the enemy rallying quickly
drove the Federal force back with considerable loss on
both sides. In return, Sunday night, the 30th, at about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
ten o'clock, the rebels "relieved the pickets" in front of
Fort Davis where the Sixty-ninth and One Hundred and
Eleventh New York were on picket duty, and managed to
capture nearly four hundred men. So delighted were the
Confederates with their success they proceeded to throw a
strong column against the works which had been uncovered
by the capture of the pickets, but the alarm had been
given and the triumphant men in gray were met with a
fire of musketry that sent them back in a hurry and, for
a time, there was a merry firing bee along the entire line.
For the nonce, honors between blue and gray were easy
and regular, expected shooting was resumed.</p>

<p>Another and the last November for the Thirty-ninth
begins and finds the remnant of the Regiment doing garrison
duty under the command of Captain Nelson of Company
A, and comparative quiet reigning along the extended
battle line, now reaching from the north side of the James
more than twenty miles to Hatcher's Run. Lieutenant
Colonel Tremlett, so long absent from the Regiment, returns
on Friday, the 4th, relieving Captain Nelson, who has led
the organization since the capture of Major F. R. Kinsley
at the Weldon Railroad. Barring considerable excitement
on the 5th, near "Fort Hell," where lines were captured by
the enemy and reversed only to be re-taken and restored,
day and night fully sustaining the reputation of the
locality, and efforts of like nature in front of Fort Steadman
on the 9th, the game of life and death was played without
special emphasis&mdash;just the steady, constant watchfulness
of thousands of men unwilling to allow any act of their
adversary to pass unnoticed. Tuesday, the 8th of November,
brings the presidential election, and the triumphant re-election
of Lincoln, all soldiers having the privilege of
voting, a singular illustration of ways in a republic where,
in becoming a soldier the man does not lose his citizenship.</p>

<p>The 24th was Thanksgiving Day in New England and
many a prayer was offered for the men at the front and
many expressions of love and recollection were speeded

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">Nov. 24, '64</span>

southward for the delectation of absent ones. Nearly
thirty tons of turkeys were said to have been sent from
the North to the armies, and this vast amount of food,
accompanied by all sorts of other meats and luxuries, must
have gone far towards furnishing forth at least one good
old-fashioned dinner for many thousands of men. As a
sort of godsend to the enemy, possibly that they, too,
might be thankful, on the 19th, some forty or fifty head of
cattle, escaping from our corrals, made for the Confederate
works where they were received as enemies, yet later
found a thoroughly warm reception. On the 26th, the
Ninetieth Pennsylvania, having reached the end of its
term of enlistment, started for Philadelphia. It had been
in the same division with the Thirty-ninth from the time
of our joining the First Corps and, for the larger part of the
period, in the same brigade. Its good qualities we had
learned to appreciate. An outgrowth of the Second
Regiment, Pennsylvania militia, it had served, under
Colonel Lyle,<a name="FNanchor_T_20" id="FNanchor_T_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_T_20" class="fnanchor">[T]</a> in the Three Months' call and, again, for

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>

three years. Recruits and re-enlisted men were transferred
to the Eleventh Pennsylvania and all that were left of the
originals were off for home. Towards the end of the month
summaries were prepared of the losses sustained by the
Army of the Potomac in the campaign so relentlessly
waged and, according to Surgeon Thos. A. McParlin,
Medical Director of the Army of the Potomac, from May
3rd to October 31st, the number of wounded amounted to
57,496, exclusive of the Eighteenth Corps while serving in
this army, and he does not include the Ninth Corps at the
Wilderness and at Spottsylvania Court House. According
to data prepared by General Warren the killed and
wounded in the Fifth Corps, during this same period,
amounted to more than eleven thousand. The precautions
taken to preserve life, and at the same time offering readiness
to receive as well as make attacks, taxed the highest talents
and ingenuity of engineers and soldiers. To the right and
left, as far as the eye could reach, were earthworks of the
strongest character, though few cared to take the risk of
prolonged observations. There were corduroy roads underground
and covered ways of heavy trunks of trees under
four or five feet of earth to prevent shells from reaching
those beneath. Few men cared to be for any considerable
time in these safety holes, the monotony and closeness
being terrible.</p>

<p>Though the Army of the Potomac is nominally in winter
quarters, this in no way prevents changes of location, the
organization of raids and a degree of activity hitherto
unknown among the veterans of one or more winter's
experience, who are carefully watching rebels while, at

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
<span class="sidenote smcap">Dec. 1, '64</span>

the same time, keeping a careful reckoning on the time
intervening before their muster-out. December comes
in with a salute to the effect that it is the last one the Regiment
will see in the field. On Thursday, the 1st, General
Gregg leads a cavalry raid down the Weldon Railroad,
starting before daylight, riding as far as Stony Creek,
twenty-two miles below Petersburg, for the sake of
destroying whatever stores may be collected there and to
destroy also whatever advance may have been made in a
proposed railroad connection between Stony Creek, the
present terminus of the Weldon Railroad, and the Southside
Road through a new track, laid down by way of the
Dinwiddie and the Boydton Roads. With considerable
adventure, this was successfully done and with a forty
mile's ride, not to mention the fighting, to their credit, the
expedition was back again at 11 p. m.</p>

<p>The early part of the month saw the return of the
Sixth Army Corps from its experiences in the valley, and
with the garlands of victory fresh upon it, the corps took its
place along the Petersburg line. In July, when the Sixth
started for Baltimore and Washington, the Union front
extended only a little further than the Jerusalem Plank
Road; now it is prolonged to Hatcher's Run, and every
foot of the prolongation has cost effort and blood; eight
miles of new frontage dearly won. Into this battle line
Sheridan's "Foot Cavalry" settles as naturally as though
it has been away only a day or two on a casual raid. What
is left of Early's force has been back with Lee several
weeks. Not satisfied with the cavalry demonstration of
the 1st, General Warren is ordered to conduct a more
formidable array on the 7th to the same region. The
troops, Fifth Corps, Mott's Division of the Second Corps
and a division of cavalry under Gregg, above 20,000 in
number with twenty-two pieces of artillery, have been
massed on both sides of the Jerusalem Road and after a
cold night, in the face of a severe rain, are off. On the
Nottoway River, they come to where Freeman's Bridge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
was formerly, twenty miles from Petersburg, and they
cross the stream on a pontoon bridge. Next day (8th) the
march southward is continued and at Jarratt's Station
where the Weldon Railroad crosses the Nottoway, thirty
miles from Petersburg, they burn the bridge, two hundred
feet long, crossing the river. The railroad track is torn
up in the effectual manner characteristic of the times and
Thursday night is spent here. Friday (9th) the work of
destruction continues down to Bellfield, twelve miles
further along. Of course there is skirmishing with the
enemy constantly, but he is not here in sufficient force to
offer substantial resistance. The troops bivouac for the
night at Three Creek, three miles this side of Bellfield. All
the time the weather has been wretched, the constant rain
rendering the roads almost impassable and, to crown all,
this night (Friday) come snow and hail to add to the
general discomfort. Saturday (10th) the expedition faces
towards Petersburg, burning on the way back the buildings
at Sussex Court House in retaliation, so said, for the
shooting of some of our stragglers and here the army
bivouacs; resuming the backward route the Nottoway was
reached in the evening of the 11th and, on the 12th, the
old quarters are struck by a very tired body of men; the
net results being a march fifty miles long, three railroad
bridges destroyed, fifteen miles of railroad track torn up
and bent out of shape and a county court house burned.</p>

<p>No mention is made in the official report of the quantity
of apple-jack which the curiously inclined Yankees sought
and found and, to their own harm, imbibed. The section
had not been overrun before, and consequently better
stored farm houses were found than the men had been
seeing of late and, notwithstanding the rigors of the campaign,
possibly on account of them, they made merry with
the seductive liquids made from innocent cider. The
story was long current that one man, outside of fully
three fingers of the booze, and growing correspondingly
free with the dignitaries, slapped General Warren familiarly

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">Dec. 10, '64</span>

on the back, calling him "The little Corporal," a term
which ever afterwards clung to the soldier himself. Canteens
of the fiery stuff were carried back to camp for the
benefit (?) of those who did not go. Had the weather been
more propitious, it is possible that the expedition would
have gone on twenty miles further to Weldon, on the
Roanoke.</p>

<p>In the foregoing episode, the Thirty-ninth bore its part,
having moved back to the rear line on the 5th and, at the
start, taking the advance of the infantry. Just before
reaching Halifax Road, the 8th, on indications of trouble
ahead the Regiment was deployed and sent forward as
skirmishers to hold the road. Having established a line of
pickets, the Thirty-ninth stood by to guard the road while
the main column passed on. Shortly after dark we
followed the troops, overtaking them near Jarratt's
Station, and there we took a hand in destroying the railroad.
On the 9th we had a place at the extreme left of the
corps, and picketed the front of the brigade, which was
doing its best to make the road a hard one for the rebels to
travel. At 6 p. m. we were withdrawn to Cross Roads,
above Bellfield, one half going on picket, the other half
into camp with the Brigade. In the movement backward,
beginning on the 10th, we fetched up the rear and thus
enjoyed frequent tilts with the close following cavalry
of the enemy who, in spite of our best efforts, managed to
capture any who straggled, in the number, our Regiment
losing four men. On the 11th, starting before daylight, we
crossed the Nottaway at four o'clock in the afternoon and
at nine halted for the night. On the 12th, we were back
again before Petersburg, having marched twelve miles.
Encamping near the Jerusalem Plank Road, we were
ordered to build huts for the winter and, following a week's
work, we moved into our new quarters where, for about a
month, we had almost easy times. At any rate we were
not right under the fire of the enemy all of the time. We
had to turn out at intervals on account of real or fancied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
dangers; drill and fatigue duties had their part and there
were the regular details for guard and picket. Once we
served as guard for a wagon train which went outside for
bricks and boards, securing the same from a deserted house
some five miles away.</p>

<p>It must be understood that absolute quiet in front of
Petersburg was out of the question. The extended works
were like a mammoth keyboard for an organ, whose
dimensions transcended imagination and, seated thereat,
all the gods and goddesses of War played music that rivaled
the thunderbolts of Jove, now the low mutterings of distant
lightning, anon rising to the fierce reverberations of an
equinoxial as when, on the 19th of December, doubly
shotted guns told the joy of the Union that Thomas had
annihilated Hood at Nashville or, on the 26th, when Mars
himself seemed to press those keys in token of the termination
of the March to The Sea and that Savannah had
fallen. Always catching up the refrain, the unterrified
rebels, aided by their own warlike deities, hurled it back
upon us, sometimes like an echo, immeasurable augmented,
till veritably it seemed that the opposing lines, stretching
away beyond human sight, could not have evoked a greater
riot of sound had they been exits of Aetna and Stromboli.
A topmost gallery seat in this magnificent theatre of war
afforded, in the very mildest passages of Freedom's
Oratorio, all the sound, melodious or otherwise, that the
average human ear could appreciate.</p>

<p>Christmas brought nothing more notable than a beautiful
day, which in the midst of a cheerless winter was
not unwelcomed, but there were none of the festivities
which untold generations have developed as essential
features of the coming of the Prince of Peace and, for that
matter, what propriety could there be in observing the
advent of the Christ Child in an army, yet the world is full
of just such anomalies. As December nears its end and
dies with the old year, careful observers scan the retrospect,
and in the deeds of Grant, Sherman, Thomas and Sheridan,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">Dec. 25, '64</span>

behold the utmost encouragement. Grierson, with his
cavalry marching from Tennessee to Louisiana, has discovered
the Confederacy to be a "shell with nothing in it."
With Grant holding Lee in his relentless clutches at Petersburg,
Thomas looking about for the scattered remnants of
Hood's Army, Price driven out of Missouri, Sheridan, at
the head of his troopers, ready to vault into the saddle, and
Sherman turning his face towards Augusta and Charleston,
seemingly the "last ditch" is very, very near. Yet, that
the enemy is not disposed to yield till forced to do so, on
the very last day of the year, when "Happy New Year" is
already ready for utterance by millions of happy voices, the
Union picket line, in the region of Forts Wadsworth and
Howard is surprised by a party of the enemy who charging
furiously, yelling and firing rapidly, drive our men back
into their main works with hardly a chance to exchange a
shot. We lose two killed, three wounded and thirty-five
captured, and the Johnnies took back with them the blankets,
knapsacks and whatever other belongings they could find.
So alert and swift were the rebels, so well had they planned
their attack that they were out of range before the men in
the forts could return their compliments. So ends the
year.</p>

<p>January, the month of good resolutions and merry
greetings, finds the opposing armies in front of Petersburg
still grimly plying their guns and wishing for the end of
the war. In the campaign from the Rapidan southward
to the end of the year, Grant has lost in killed, wounded
and captured more men than Lee was reputed to have had
under his command when the fight began, yet the line in
blue in front of the beleaguered city is just as persistent,
just as vigorous as when the siege was started. While the
exhaustless resources of the North are indicated by Lincoln's
call for a half million more soldiers and follows that
with a proposition to draft 300,000 more, Lee is writing
the Confederate Secretary of War, "There is nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
within reach of this army to be impressed. The country
is swept clear. Our only reliance is upon the railroads.
We have but two days' supplies." General B. F. Butler,
after the failure of the Fort Fisher attack has been relieved
and sent home to Lowell, and General Terry is organizing
a new expedition against the great fortification and ere
the month is over his success will be heralded the country
over. In its snug cabins or huts, the Potomac Army is
gaining strength for the signal which will draw the men
from their repose and send them forward. The winter is
unusually severe, but, well clad and covered, the men
in blue wot little of the sufferings of their adversaries in
gray who are passing through all of the anguish which
their fathers knew at Valley Forge. Of the Fifth Corps it
need be said only that it and its many regiments are writing
letters home, reading the matter sent them from those
same homes, watching the foe and looking toward the end.
The end of the month was signalized by the arrival of the
so-called Peace Commission, consisting of Vice-President
Alexander H. Stephens of the Confederacy and others who,
February 3rd, met President Lincoln and Secretary
Seward at Fortress Monroe, but, as the President would
not enter into any negotiations without assurance of
unconditional acknowledgment of perpetual union and the
abolition of slavery, which the Confederates were not
prepared to grant, nothing came of the meeting.</p>

<p>It is in this same January that Major A. R. Small, in
his history of the Sixteenth Maine<a name="FNanchor_U_21" id="FNanchor_U_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_U_21" class="fnanchor">[U]</a> has the following very

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
<span class="sidenote smcap">Jan. 31, '65</span>

pleasant words about the Thirty-ninth, words that the
members of the Bay State Regiment thoroughly appreciate
and fully reciprocate:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Among the strongest and most lasting attachments formed by
the Sixteenth for other troops during its term of service was that
for the Thirty-ninth Massachusetts, Colonel Davis commanding.
I have no record of the date when it joined the First Brigade, but
it was a day which marked an era of progressive good feeling,
which ripened into warm, personal attachments. The Regiment
was splendidly officered, and under its able commander was an
ever present incentive for us to do our very best. We never
reached its precision in the manual of arms. We doubt if in this
particular qualification it had a superior in the army; certainly
it had not an equal in the Corps. Colonel Davis had a quiet
way of coming into our hearts and he came to stay.</p></div>

<p>Though the men in the ranks knew it not, nor for that
matter did the majority of the officers, yet it is stated
that on the last night in January orders went to the several
Corps of the Potomac Army to be ready to march. From
that moment activity was prevalent; increased firing
along the front concealed to some extent the work of the
railroad in bringing up the necessary supplies from City
Point. As early as the 4th of February came orders to
the Regiment to be ready to move at a moment's notice.
The 5th brought the order to report at brigade headquarters
where the other regiments of that body were found,
and the Corps was joined at 7 a. m. As usual Gregg's
cavalry had preceded us and as on several former occasions
the Fifth Corps leads the infantry to be followed by
the Second and a repetition of the Hatcher's Run incidents
of last October and December. The Fifth Corps is
to pass around the enemy's right flank while the other
troops assail in front; Crawford's Division to which the
Thirty-ninth belongs marches last. Our direction is toward
Dinwiddie Court House within two miles of which we
camp for the night. Monday, the 6th, we are detailed for
picket duty; in the afternoon we cross Hatcher's Run and
in the first battle-line we are at the right, the enemy being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
strongly entrenched at Dabney's Mills. The first attempt
to dislodge the rebels is unsuccessful, but in a second charge
we take the works which, however, we are compelled to
vacate because of lack of support.</p>

<p>The events of this day so far as the Second Brigade is
concerned are effectively told by Major Isaac Hall, historian
of the Ninety-seventh New York, at this time a part
of the Brigade:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Early in the afternoon of the following day (6th), Crawford's
Division moved forward into the woods in search of the enemy.
He was supported on the left by Ayers' (Second) Division;
Gregg's cavalry being on the extreme flank. This movement
covered the Vaughn and Dabney Mill roads, and Baxter's
Brigade was on the right of the column. The enemy's skirmishers
were soon reached and pressed back upon the main line of
Pegram's Division of Gordon's Corps, which also retired to the
ruins of an old mill, where it made a stand. As the brigade came
to an opening, a formidable fort&mdash;as was supposed&mdash;presented
itself to view, and a strife occurred between the color bearers of
the Sixteenth Maine and the Ninety-seventh New York as to
which should first plant its standard upon the fort. The contestant
of the Ninety-seventh achieved the victory; but great was
his disappointment when instead of a veritable fort he found only
a huge heap of saw-dust. A lively musketry fire was kept up
here for twenty or thirty minutes, when Mahone's heavy columns
came to the support of the line in our front. This was a
most inopportune moment for the Fifth Corps; many of the men
were already out of ammunition and the line surged back in spite
of the officers. General Warren was himself at the front and with
his ready glass was coolly surveying the enemy. He was pointed
to by the officers, and as if ashamed of themselves the men faced
about, but this was of no account since only a few shots were
fired; the best of men will not stand with empty muskets and be
shot down, and to charge with empty cartridge boxes and
unloaded pieces was out of the question; hence the retreat was
continued, not precipitately, but the line surged slowly and sullenly
to the rear. The enemy was not eager to follow, as if
doubting the sincerity of our retreat. An ordnance wagon had
been ordered up, and some four or five hundred yards in front of
our works Captain Trembly was met with an ammunition wagon
with which, in the narrow road, he could neither advance nor
retreat and was about to destroy it. The wagon was caught by

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">Feb. 6, '65</span>

the men and quickly changed ends, and when our trenches were
reached the ammunition was quickly distributed. A part of the
Sixth Corps had arrived, and as the Fifth emerged from the
woods it was fired into by the former, which seemed inclined to
dispute our passage to the rear, some raw troops mistaking our
line for that of the enemy. The latter did not press heavily upon
our fortified position but seemed satisfied to know that our
forces were well up. Our men lay upon their arms through the
long, cold night. The morning of the 7th was cold and rainy;
the rain soon turned to sleet which covered the ground and rendered
the movements of troops difficult and somewhat dangerous.
Our hands became so benumbed that it was difficult to handle
our pieces, still we held our positions and occasionally advanced
upon the enemy, which seemed to consist of a thin, gray line
covering itself in the woods.</p></div>

<p>The foregoing wagon incident is told in quite a different
manner by a survivor of our Regiment who believes in
giving credit to him to whom credit is due:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>At the battle of Hatcher's Run, Feb. 6th, 1865, our forces made
a charge on the rebels, driving them back quite a distance; four
of our ammunition wagons followed in through a cart path, when
all at once our line broke and began falling back. The Captain
of the ordnance wagons became rattled and ordered Sergeant
W. P. Brown of Company K, Thirty-ninth, who was ordnance
sergeant under him, to have the drivers unhitch the mules and
burn the wagons, he himself taking the first two wagons and
destroying them. Sergeant Brown kept his head, turned his two
wagons around and saved one of them, the other, breaking a
pole, had to be abandoned; the Captain in the meantime lost
his horse, which was caught by Sergeant Brown, who went back
in search of the officer, whom he found wandering about like a
crazy man. Brown managed to get him on his horse and piloted
him to the rear. Now comes the injustice, the Captain was complimented
very highly on his bravery, a picture came out in the
New York papers showing him destroying the wagons to keep
them out of the hands of the rebels, while Brown was never
mentioned or noticed in any way. Brown said that if he had had
full charge, he could have saved three of the wagons at least,
for he would have been perfectly sober&mdash;"To him that hath
shall be given."</p></div>

<p>The particular part borne by the Thirty-ninth was to
form in line at 8 a. m. and then to be deployed as skir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>mishers
in front of the Brigade. Thus advancing, the
skirmishers of the enemy were driven from three lines of
rifle pits back into their main works which were near.
At 5 p. m. our line was ordered to advance upon them,
but the assault proving unsuccessful the line fell back to
its original position where it remained exposed to a galling
fire till late at night, when it was relieved. Wednesday,
the 8th, was spent in bivouac, a couple of miles back of
the scene of Tuesday's activities. The next day (9th),
the Regiment went on picket and, when relieved on Friday,
the 10th, it moved back to its old camp, near the Jerusalem
Plank Road to get the men's baggage that had been stored
there. After this ebulition, which cost the Fifth Corps
1,165 killed and wounded and 154 missing, quiet again
fell on the army, and on the 11th, moving out to the
extreme Union left near Hatcher's Run, camp was again
pitched and winter quarters were once more prepared.
One writer says that the Brigade was camped near the
Goshen House, the Fifth Corps being massed in rear of
the Second. However disagreeable such variations in
what many would have made a peaceful winter may have
been to the soldiers, there is not a doubt that the lesson of
constant watchfulness was thoroughly impressed upon
everyone, officers as well as men. Here, subjected to the
accustomed routine of camp and picket duty, February
wore away.</p>

<p>The beginning of March brought little if any variation
on the ending of the preceding month, yet there was a
feeling in most minds that the month would bring on the
commencement of active hostilities. Everybody knew
that Sherman had reached North Carolina, and that
General Joe Johnston, with such forces as he could secure,
was trying to prevent the further advance of the triumphant
army northward. The line whose beginning we heard
announced amid the thunders of Spottsylvania had
encompassed Petersburg and was slowly but surely extending
towards that never ending left. Though the army

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">Mar., '65</span>

did not know it, General Lee in these March days had
sought an interview with Grant with reference to some
solution of the problem so long under consideration. The
latter had wisely referred the matter to Washington,
whence Lincoln warned the Lieutenant General against
having any conference with Lee unless to accept his surrender.
Save for just a little vigor shown by Sheridan
and his cavalry there was practically nothing doing in the
Old Dominion till away past the middle of the month
when, on the 25th, the Confederates made their charge
upon Fort Steadman, in front of the Ninth Corps, the very
last aggressive movement on the part of the Army of
Northern Virginia, effectually demonstrating to the exacting
Confederacy that its soldiery had fired its last charge
of ammunition in attack and that hopeless resistance and
flight were the only resources left.</p>

<p>As side lights to the story of a single regiment in the
great struggle, it might be said that United States Senator
E. B. Washburn of Minnesota came down from Washington,
arriving at City Point March 10th, the bearer of the
medal which Congress had voted to General Grant for
his distinguished services; the presentation was made in
the main cabin of the steamer which brought the Senator,
the evening of the 11th, the day itself having been given to
a ride through the army and a review of some of the troops.
General Meade and staff were present at the presentation,
which was made in eloquent words by Washburn, a personal
friend of Grant, and the latter received his honor
with all the modesty that ever characterized all of his acts.
While all this was taking place and the infantry of the
great army was gaining strength for the coming ordeal,
Sheridan and his ever untiring cavalry were continuing
the raid on which, with 10,000 riders, he had started from
Winchester, February 27th and, like a cloudy pillar by
day and one of fire by night, he had ridden southward,
once more administering severe punishment to Early and
his followers; between Staunton and Charlottesville, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
destroyed mills and factories, a considerable portion of the
James River Canal, railroad bridges and tracks; and now,
with his wearied horsemen, is approaching White House
on the Pamunkey River.</p>

<p>Nor was March altogether one of idleness for the Thirty-ninth,
since the new quarters constructed in February had
to be maintained, and ordinary policing of camp will
insure an appetite for any healthy soldier, and picket duty
added kept everybody busy even if they were not marching
and fighting. A newspaper correspondent of the day,
having been through the camp and finding it extremely
well kept, commented on the same in exceedingly complimentary
terms, concluding with, "and the soldiers are
spoiling for a fight," which, coming to the observation of
the men, one of them thus moralized in his diary, "To
say that a soldier is anxious for a fight and is eagerly
waiting for a combat with the enemy is talk that savors of
nonsense; only a lunatic would use such words. A soldier
can be brave and can most ardently wish for the overthrow
of the enemy, and be willing to fight if he must,
but he never desires battle when strategy will do just as
well, unless drunk or crazy like some of the newspaper
men." Thursday, the 9th of March, brought along a
pleasure in that the Regiment passed in review before
that most excellent former division commander, General
John C. Robinson, who had been so severely wounded at
Laurel Hill and was just getting about once more. On
the 14th, General Warren conducted a review of the entire
Corps, a fact that set men to remarking that a move-out
would soon be in order. Two days later, the 16th, another
exhibition of our soldierly attributes and attainments was
made for the edification of Secretary of War Edward M.
Stanton and others, the Thirty-ninth acquitting itself in
a praiseworthy manner.</p>

<p>The expiring thrust of the Rebellion, the assault and
temporary capture of Fort Steadman on Saturday, the
25th of March, called for immediate aid from different

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">March 25, '65</span>

parts of the line, the Thirty-ninth with others; coming at
five o'clock in the morning it was a great surprise to all
of us; though the attack was about ten miles to the right,
the noise of heavy artillery was excessive, and the Fifth
Corps in light marching order was ordered to the rescue
at once. The response was immediate and eager, and the
Corps had a commendable pride in itself as it moved out
of its several camps with brave Warren at its head, marching
briskly towards the conflict, but before the scene could
be reached the firing ceased and we were halted till, all
danger passed, we were ordered back to camp. Near the
Gurley House the Corps was reviewed by President Lincoln,
it being not a little interesting that the President and
his family had arrived at City Point the night before and
he was near enough to see the 1600 prisoners taken at the
Fort as they marched by.</p>

<p>It was March 24th, or the day before the assault on
Fort Steadman, that Generals Grant and Meade issued
their orders for the general movement against the enemy,
the same to begin on the 29th. The Fifth Corps was in
reserve and occupying camps in the rear of and to the left
of the Second Corps. Griffin's (First) Division was on
the right, closely connecting with the Second Corps; Ayres'
(Second) was next at Griffin's left and Crawford's (Third)
was still further to the left and near the Halifax Road.
The movable force of the Potomac Army consisted of the
Second and Fifth Corps and Sheridan's Cavalry. By the
orders of March 27th General Warren was to march at
3 a. m. on the 29th and, crossing Hatcher's Run at W.
Perkin's house, thence to march to the junction of the
Old Stage Road and the Vaughn Road and from that point
to open communications with the Second Corps, having
accomplished which he was to move to a position in the
vicinity of Dinwiddie Court House. These orders were
subsequently somewhat modified. How near these days
were to the end no one realized, though Grant had been
exceedingly apprehensive that Lee would endeavor to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
move out from his entrenchments and, if possible, effect
a junction with Johnston to the southward, yet not even
his far seeing mind realized that less than two weeks
separated these late March days from the final wind-up.
History is to be made rapidly in the coming days; Sheridan
is to "push things," and the latest enlisted man is to
march and fight feeling that every step and blow are
telling against the effort to disrupt the Union.</p>

<p>The right of Lee's army is the object that Sheridan and
his forces are seeking. He has his cavalry well in hand
and had asked for the Sixth Corps, having in the Valley
learned some of its qualities, but that Corps was so placed
in the entrenched lines that its withdrawal was impracticable,
and the Fifth was sent instead. Proverbially
rainy, March of 1865 outdid itself and so watered the
scene of hostilities that movements of any kind seemed
almost impossible. <a name="FNanchor_V_22" id="FNanchor_V_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_V_22" class="fnanchor">[V]</a>Warren's advance began at 3 a. m. on
the 29th according to schedule, General Joshua L. Chamberlain
commanding the First Brigade of Griffin's (first)
Division in the lead; the crossing was made by pontoons
over Rowanty Creek, the name given to the stream made
by the union of Hatcher's and Gravelly Runs. The
Corps was halted at the Quaker Road whence, to insure
against surprise, advance guards and supports were
pushed to within two miles of Dinwiddie Court House.
At 10.12 a. m. Warren was ordered by General Meade to
move up the Quaker Road to Gravelly Run and thence
to throw out parties to the right that he might find the left
of Humphreys, commanding the second Corps. At noon
he was ordered to cross the Run and advance to Boydton
Plank Road which was done, though considerable delay was
occasioned by reason of the stream not being fordable
and the laying of a pontoon bridge was hindered by the
exceptional steepness of the banks of the stream. About
this time the enemy was developed and his skirmishers

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
<span class="sidenote smcap">March 29, '65</span>

were driven back till near the junction of the Quaker
and Boydton Roads. Here, supported by Gregory of
Griffin's Second Brigade, Chamberlain attacked and drove
the rebels beyond the junction. It was about 6 p. m.
when the assault was made, the sun being about half an
hour high. Pushing on rapidly to the Plank Road, we
went into bivouac at nine o'clock, holding the Plank
Road from Gravelly Run to near Rainey's house where
Griffin halted for the night, his pickets on the right reaching
those of the Second Corps.</p>

<p>Sergt. Wm. A. Mentzer, Company A, recalls that in
falling back he and his tentmate, I. H. Mitchell, in their
anxiety to get a few more shots at the foe stopped behind
an old shed, but they waited a bit too long, for the Rebels
were near enough to get a cross fire on them, on which
they started back in a hurry, but within a very few rods
Mitchell got a shot which went right through him; however,
his height was just right to enable him to throw his
arm over Mentzer's shoulder and thus they weathered
the storm of bullets, which, he said, made the mud through
which they were running fairly bubble, for the enemy was
determined to get them, and glad enough they were to
reach the reformed line of the Regiment. Mitchell's
wound healed all right and in 1913 he survives with his
Sergeant to tell the story.</p>

<p>From right to left, the Fifth Corps divisions are Griffin's,
Ayres's and Crawford's, the latter in which was the thirty-ninth
being nearest Gravelly Run. During the night
began the severe rain already alluded to, coming in torrents
till the afternoon of the 31st. Full of swamps and ravines,
the sand and clay were easily transformed into quicksands;
much of the way was quite impassable unless corduroyed;
a part of the land was covered with dense forest
and undergrowth, so that being very flat the water was
quickly carried off. Rowanty Creek, over which the
Corps had gone on the 29th, rose so rapidly that on the
30th the pontoon bridge was one hundred feet too short<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
and the wagons of the Corps had to wait until mid-day of
the 31st. Notwithstanding this condition, Griffin's Division
was advanced up the Boydton Road until the enemy
was driven into his main line of works along the White
Oak Road. During the 30th, the Thirty-ninth Regiment
was on the skirmish line all day while those behind were
busy entrenching, though the work was slow since all the
tools that could be obtained belonged to the pioneers,
those in the wagons not being available, as stated before.
It was observed, as an interesting fact, that the advance
was then occupying substantially the same position held
by Hancock in October of the preceding year. On this
30th of March, General Ayres, according to directions,
sent out one of his brigades on a reconnoisance; his advance
reached the Holliday house without opposition, crossing
a stream which was to play an important part in the
operations of the next day, going over the same with so
much ease that he did not deem it worthy of mention as
an obstacle in his report, though then the rain was falling
furiously. Meanwhile Crawford and his Third Division
had relieved the two remaining brigades of Ayres's Division
and now occupied the line from Gravelly Run to Rainey's
house.</p>

<p>During these movements the proceedings of the enemy
were quite visible and from captures made by our troops
it was learned that there was a considerable tendency of
the Confederates towards Five Forks. In reporting this
information to headquarters, Warren suggested that Griffin
be relieved by Humphreys and that the entire Fifth Corps
should support the advance of Ayres, intimating that, if
allowed to do this, he could effectually block the White
Oak Road and prevent its further use by the enemy.
At 9 p. m. orders were received substantially in accord with
General Warren's proposition, and Warren at once disposed
of his forces so that Ayres should lead, supported
by Crawford and Griffin whenever the arrival of Humphreys
would permit. At 8.15, in the morning of the 31st,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
<span class="sidenote smcap">March 31, '65</span>

Ayres is informed by General Warren that Merritt's cavalry
has been driven from the White Oak Road and that
he must observe his left with the utmost care lest the
enemy assail him from the west as well as from the north,
a possibility at every step of the movement from the
Rapidan southward. Still heavily falls the rain, diminutive
brooks become swiftly flowing streams and ordinary creeks
speedily grow to be roaring torrents.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p>It was 10.30 when Ayres's advance was made, but it
seemed that the enemy was like minded with the Union
Army and he too was approaching with a far larger force
than that of the Federals. The Union line slowly withdrew
to its original position while other troops were
hurried to its support but without avail and to add to the
dangers of the situation a heavy column of the enemy was
discovered approaching from the west. Unable to withstand
the Confederate advance, our lines gave way in
considerable confusion. Crawford's Third Division was
thrown into the breach but was too unsteady to stay, and
so fell into the general retreat before the enemy. The
Thirty-ninth had been thrown forward as skirmishers,
they were known as the skirmishers for the Brigade, being
near the Holliday house and holding their place with
steadiness, but, outflanked by the enemy, of necessity they
fell back with the rest. General Baxter, commanding the
Brigade, strengthened the line of the Thirty-ninth with the
Eleventh Pennsylvania, both regiments being composed of
hardened campaigners who did their best; but the odds
were too great and they slowly gave way, expecting to rally
on the division which, however, had fallen back to the
branch of Gravelly Run. Lieut. Colonel Tremlett who, as
a member of the Twentieth Regiment, had been inducted
into battle at Ball's Bluff, here received his mortal wound
and was borne from the field. Captain Willard C. Kinsley,
Company K, was also mortally wounded and the command
of the regiment devolved upon Captain Cooper of Company
F.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>When General Warren reached the scene of conflict and
realized the situation he seized the flag of a Pennsylvania
regiment and rode up and down the lines, trying to stem
the retreat but without avail, it being evident that the
men would not stop on the western side of the branch of
Gravelly Run, mentioned in the advance of Ayres on the
30th. Still waving his flag and trying to halt the men on
the eastern side of the stream, he succeeded in once more
forming a well ordered line and the approach of the enemy
was effectually withstood and Griffin's men recrossing the
branch drove the enemy back. By this time Humphreys,
still further to the east, sent reinforcements so that the
rebels were effectually prevented from making any further
serious attack. At 2.30 in the afternoon the Union Army
again advanced and effectually drove the enemy back over
all the ground won in the forenoon and never halted until
it was on the White Oak Road, the Confederates themselves
saying it was one of the most gallant charges that
they had ever seen. "Crawford now reached the road
and, following the line of the rebel entrenchment to the
east, connected with Miles of the Second Corps, who had
advanced and driven the enemy into their works to the
east and to the Plank Road." Ayres also had not fired a
musket in this advance, was halted just before reaching the
road, and, still covering the left near the house of W.
Dabney, looked down the road towards Five Forks. The
enemy had failed in his effort to double up the Union left
and what was worse for him had lost the White Oak Road
and was effectually penned up within his works.</p>

<p>All this time Sheridan was having more trouble than
usually fell to the lot of Little Phil. He was near Dinwiddie
Court House and the cavalry of the enemy was making
a more stubborn showing than was their wont, indeed
the men in blue were yielding to those in gray and late in
the afternoon, Warren sent a brigade (Bartlett's) of Griffin's
Division to Sheridan's relief, this being the first of

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">April 1, '65</span>

the Fifth Corps to move to the assistance of Sheridan in
response to his call for infantry.</p>

<p>April 1st, so often mingled in Anglo Saxon minds with
fooleries of all descriptions, was one of intense earnestness
to the long time rivals along that line, reaching from the
other or further side of James River to Five Forks, a distance
of nearly or quite forty miles. Good Bishop Berkeley's
aphorism as to the Star of Empire and its western way
has another application as General Ord and his divisions
from the Twenty-fourth and Twenty-fifth Corps leave the
north side of the James to Weitzel and his colored troops,
and moving westward occupy space to the left of the
Sixth; from the right of the latter, Parke and the Ninth
Corps extend to the James. Humphreys and the Second
Corps are between Ord and the Fifth Corps, while Sheridan
and his troopers are at the extreme left, making sure that
the Confederates shall not escape to the southward. So
generally have the rebel lines been reduced at Lee's left,
it seems strange that the Union troops in that locality did
not advance into the all but empty trenches. A wonderfully
alert line of men is that which, looking northward,
sees the earthworks which must be stormed, and that
right early. The showing of Confederate cavalry at the
Union left, with the constant coming of infantry, demands
its destruction and this is the task that Sheridan has set
for himself on this day.</p>

<p>The last day of March saw Sheridan at the close of a day
not entirely to his liking, and a portion of the Fifth Corps
was hurrying to his aid. General Horace Porter in his
"Campaigning with Grant" says, "The Fifth Corps had
borne the brunt of the fighting ever since the army had
moved out on March 29th; and the gallant men who composed
it, and who had performed a conspicuous part in
nearly every battle in which the Army of the Potomac
had been engaged, seemed eager once more to cross bayonets
with their old antagonists. But the movement was
slow, the required formation seemed to drag, and Sheridan,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
chafing with impatience and consumed with anxiety,
became as restive as a racer struggling to make the start."
For many reasons the advance of Warren's men towards
Five Forks was slow; Ayres and the Second Division went
first and reported to Sheridan or one of the latter's staff
officers before daylight of the 1st; under orders, the commands
of Griffin and Crawford began their march towards
Five Forks before daylight of the 1st. The movement
was made with considerable caution because of information
as to the positions of the enemy, stated the night before by
Sheridan, and with consequent slowness. At 7 and 8 a. m.
respectively Griffin's and Crawford's Divisions halted and
were permitted to cook their breakfasts and to rest, General
Warren halting with them. In the formation of the Corps
finally, Crawford was on the right, Ayres on the left with
Griffin massed in rear of Crawford's right flank; Baxter's
Brigade in which the Thirty-ninth was ranged held the
extreme right of the Third Division.</p>

<p>The orders were to advance to the White Oak Road and
to swing to the left, keeping the sun over the left shoulder.
When the advance was made it was found that the line was
half a mile too far to the right and a readjustment was
necessary. In this effort, Crawford's Division was thrown
directly into the air and it seemed as though he were
marching away from the field. General Warren<a name="FNanchor_W_23" id="FNanchor_W_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_W_23" class="fnanchor">[W]</a> hastened

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
<span class="sidenote smcap">Apr. 1, '65</span>

to rearrange the confused line, an effort not unaccompanied
with difficulty. In this particular movement, as a regiment
in the Third Division, the Thirty-ninth bore its part and
of this Captain Charles H. Porter says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>After getting over the White Oak Road we never saw any clearing
of any description until we came over the cleared field in which
were the chimneys of some houses, which is marked "chimneys"
on the map. We swung to the north of those chimneys and as
the line came around we went into the woods again. Coulter,
who had been in reserve, was now on the line of battle and connected
with the Second Brigade, Baxter's.</p></div>

<p>It was a very wide sweep that the Third Division made
and in its progress a battery was captured, the division
being under fire all of the time, and this advance of Crawford's
men caused an evacuation of the enemy's entrenchments.
Again quoting Captain Porter, we have:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>As the Third Division neared Five Forks, under orders from
General Warren, the troops were faced west and we pushed on
with our left a little north of the White Oak Road, and when we
reached the clearing known as Gilliams' we found the enemy had
made a final stand and erected temporary earthworks at right
angles to their original lines. The men being out of breath and
the formation somewhat broken, the troops halted and opened a
desultory fire upon the enemy. General Warren, hastening up,
quickly discovered the cause of the delay and, after giving a little
time to the reforming of the troops, a very good line was formed,
and under the gallant leadership of him who had commanded us
for more than a year the troops sprang forward and carried the
works. General Warren's horse was shot under him, directly
astride the works; and Lieut. Colonel Richardson received the
bullet that would have struck our beloved corps commander. By
this time, the night was well upon us, and, the enemy being
thoroughly dispersed, the troops were halted and General Warren
sent one of his staff to find General Sheridan and to ask for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>further orders. The aide reached Sheridan and received in reply
the words that orders had been sent to Warren, and not long
after Bankhead's return, Colonel Forsyth arrived with the order
from Sheridan relieving Warren from the command of the
corps.</p>

<p>Thus on the field of battle after the most successful day's
work that he had ever taken part in, Warren was deprived of the
command of the corps which he had commanded since March, 1864,
and a position which he had earned by soldierly courage and
brilliant conduct on many fields. Beginning at Great Bethel, his
name is associated with every field upon which the Army of the
Potomac was engaged. The insulting remark and the tone and
gestures of Sheridan, when he alluded to Warren's services on
this day, are a disgrace to this brilliant man. There is no excuse
nor palliation for them. The most ardent friend that Sheridan
has cannot explain away the insult conveyed to one of the bravest
and most devoted of soldiers in the Army of the Potomac.</p>

<p>Crawford's Division suffered more than the other portions of
the corps, its casualties being nearly equal to those of the other two
divisions. We came under fire as soon as any of the corps and continued
to be under fire until after the attack on Gilliam's field.</p></div>

<p>Long years after the war Sergt. Wm. A. Mentzer of
"A" was wont to tell of seeing Sheridan at Five Forks
with his Staff, riding along the rear of our lines, shouting,
"See the Sons of B&mdash;&mdash;s run! Give them H&mdash;L, boys!"
"After going a little way into the woods we came to the
rear of the Rebel works, where I saw a lad behind the same
firing at our folks. Jamming on my bayonet I jumped
to the works and ordered him to come out; he looked up
and had the impudence, with a smile on his face, to say,
'I wish you would let me fire these five cartridges.' I
think I swore some and told him I'd put the bayonet
right through him unless he came out at once, and he came.
When going to the rear with my prisoner I saw General
Warren riding the same way, but not till the next morning
did I know that our great and good leader had been relieved
of his command."</p>

<p>April 2d, as usual when the most important military
operations are to be undertaken, is Sunday and at 4.45 a. m.
signal guns announced the general advance of the Union

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">Apr. 2, '65</span>

forces in front of Petersburg, from the Appomattox to Five
Forks and beyond. Within half an hour, Wright of the
Sixth Corps sends word to Grant that he has carried the
enemy's lines in front of his position, and Parke of the
Ninth reports that he has captured the outer works with
artillery and 800 prisoners, and, before seven o'clock, the
Lieut. General telegraphs President Lincoln at City Point
the good news. This is the day in which Richmond, the
Confederate Capital, lulled into fancied security, quite
ignorant of the havoc along the Petersburg lines, is actually
attending church and President Davis is summoned from
his pew in St. Paul's church with the overwhelming news
that the Yankees are coming. How pandemonium broke
loose, how the iron clads and other ships in the James
River were destroyed; how the three bridges which spanned
the James were burned; and Richmond, itself, by a fire
set by the Confederates and extinguished by the Union
troops, suffered worse than Columbia from the alleged
inhumanity of Sherman&mdash;all this is history. Every man
who wore the blue seemed to have a mission to find someone
in gray and the latter, be it said to his everlasting credit,
was nothing loath to be found.</p>

<p>Until the afternoon of the 2d, the Fifth Corps was employed
on the field of Five Forks in caring for the wounded,
burying the dead and destroying the old arms of the captured
Confederates. After these accomplishments the
Corps, now under General Griffin, received orders to proceed
towards Petersburg, Chamberlain's Brigade of Bartlett's
Division (till yesterday, Griffin's) leading. Whatever
opposition was encountered, it was speedily swept away
and, at Church Road Crossing of the South Side Railroad,
fifteen miles from Petersburg, a passing train of cars was
captured. Crossing the railroad he was ordered to push
out if possible to the Cox Road, crossing the line of march
at right angles. The First Division continued towards
Sutherland Station, still nearer Petersburg, while Crawford's
coming up, at about 3 p. m., went over the road<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
with cheers, thence passing down the same about seven
miles it turned to the left, marching till 6.30 before halting
for the night. In some places the stream at which the stop
was made is called Namozine while General Humphreys'
map has it Whipponock and here some annalist says the
enemy got combative during the evening and the Thirty-ninth,
as usual, went out on skirmish duty, when a few shots
seemed to settle the matter for the rebels, of whom nothing
more was heard during the night.</p>

<p>The great Confederate army that had withstood our onslaughts
so many years is clearly trying to escape "on the
run" is the thought in the minds of those who follow.
The Union cavalry, led by the fiery Custer, is keeping the
rear guard of the enemy in plain sight and the infantry is
following as rapidly as it can. With the exception of Willcox's
Division of the Ninth Corps, which is occupying
Petersburg, the entire Potomac Army is in the chase; it is
the day when Godfrey Weitzel marches into Richmond
and extinguishes the conflagration started by the retiring
foe; President Lincoln, leading his son, Tad, enters Petersburg
and personally congratulates Grant on the great
victory; of the meeting General Horace Porter says, "I
doubt whether Mr. Lincoln ever experienced a happier
moment in his life." The Fifth Corps follows hard after
the cavalry, picking up many prisoners with five pieces
of abandoned artillery and a number of wagons. At night,
with Crook's Division of cavalry, the Corps encamps on
the Nazomine Road, near Deep Creek. On the morning
of the 4th, the Corps moves directly and rapidly towards
Jetersville, a station on the Richmond and Danville R. R.,
Sheridan thinking that the rebels are collecting at Amelia
Court House about eight miles northeast of Jetersville.
On arriving we are ordered to entrench with a view of
holding the point until the main army can come up. The
position of the Corps is an exposed one, of which Sheridan
in his report says, "The enemy lost its last chance of
escape by failure to advance and attack the comparatively

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">Apr. 4, '65</span>

small force and so march on its way to Burkeville."
However, luckily for the troops at Jetersville, the Confederates
are not reaching the Court House as rapidly as
Sheridan thinks and by the afternoon of the 5th, the
Second and the Sixth Corps are up and ranged in line with
the Fifth. While not described in detail, the whole world
knows that everybody was busy in those days with scant
time for sleep at night, but through the bewildering maze
of horse and foot, it is ours to follow only the men of a
single corps and that the Fifth. Many a page might be
given to reciting the incidents of Sailor's Creek, the last
pitched battle in the East, but our regiment was not in it.
At last Sheridan had obtained his wish and the Sixth Corps,
having been sent to him, wins renown in this final struggle,
while the Fifth moves off at the right of the Second through
Paineville on Deatonville. It proved a long, rapid and
tiresome march, a distance of thirty-two miles to Ligontown
Ferry, experiencing no greater variety on the way
than the destruction of abandoned army wagons, gun
carriages and caissons of the enemy and the capture of
some prisoners.</p>

<p>Says Powell in his History of the Fifth Army Corps,
"No army in the world could stand such losses as Lee was
meeting every day, and no troops could long endure the
strain and fatigue of marching all night and fighting by
day, as Lee's men were now enduring. They were by this
time deprived of everything, even food, and those captured
presented a pitiable condition." Though the slumbers of
the Union Army are not as prolonged as they may have
been at other times, nevertheless there are halts and rations
are had, and with full stomachs and a boundless supply of
ammunition the pursuit is maintained. Friday, the 7th,
General Meade orders Griffin with the Fifth Corps to proceed
to Prince Edward Court House while the Second and
the Sixth keep up the direct pursuit. Our Corps crosses
the South side R. R. at Rice's Station, just fifty miles
west of Petersburg and forty from Appomattox. General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
Grant's first letter to General Lee, relative to surrender,
bears the date of the 7th and the answer of the great
Confederate, asking for terms, is dated the same day.
Whatever his intentions, Lee does not await the statement
of Grant, but pushes on through the night towards the
west on his hopeless task. The morning of the 8th beholds
the tireless Second Corps, closely followed by the Sixth, in
eager pursuit. The Fifth Corps also has an early start and
striking the Lynchburg R. R. at Prospect Station, twenty
miles from Appomattox, at about noon, follows thence
Ord's forces towards Appomattox Court House and at
2 a. m. of the 9th, Sunday, bivouacks about two miles
from the site of the immortal scene so soon to be enacted
having marched twenty-nine miles from Prince Edward's
Court House.</p>

<p>Meantime, on the 8th, Grant and Lee had again exchanged
courtesies, the former writing to Lee that his surrender
could be accepted only on the understanding that
his soldiers should not take up arms against the United
States until properly exchanged, and the famous Virginia
names the 9th as the day for their meeting, stipulating
however that it need not necessarily lead to his surrender,
and 10 a. m. as the hour. All this is not known to the rank
and file, who for ought they know are still due for weeks of
marching and fighting, though for the last few days there
has been considerably more of the former than of the
latter. Accordingly there was no surprise abroad when
the familiar assembly call rang out on the morning air of
the 9th and without rations the day before, or breakfast
this morning, at four o'clock, the Corps moved from its
bivouac and reached the headquarters of General Sheridan
at 6 a. m. The cavalry evidently was hotly engaged and
the Twenty-fourth Corps was moving out when Ayers of
the Fifth (Second Div.), followed by Bartlett and the
First Division, took position also. General Griffin reported
that the failure of the Third Division to be in line with
the others was entirely the fault of the commander, though

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>

<span class="sidenote smcap">Apr. 9, '65</span>

he had been notified of the necessity of keeping well closed
up; as a result the division did not reach its proper position
till after hostilities for the day were over.</p>

<p>The 9th day of April will figure in history as one of the
most important dates ever recorded; the correspondence,
now passing between Grant and Lee, will rank with the
other all but sacred documents in our national records.
Hostilities had begun and our lines were pressing forward,
driving the enemy, when a message was received from
Sheridan that fighting should cease as the Confederates
were about to surrender. On the scenes that follow&mdash;those
beneath the famous apple tree and within the parlor
of Wilmer McLean, where foemen "worthy of their steel"
were assembled&mdash;it does not behoove us to linger, for they
are as familiar as household tales throughout the land.
The two pre-eminent figures, those of Grant and Lee, meet
face to face, each one increasing the esteem in which he
must be held as long as the Nation lives.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"These in the robings of glory,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Those in the gloom of defeat,</div>
<div class="verse">All with the battle-blood gory,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">In the dusk of eternity meet."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>While the great majority of the triumphant army,
setting their faces homeward, start on the return march
the next day after the surrender, to the troops of General
Ord and the First Division of the Fifth Corps is entrusted
the honor as well as task of receiving the formal "laying
down of arms" by the beaten Confederates. This crowning
event does not take place until the 12th, the Fourth anniversary
of the firing upon Sumpter, when at nine o'clock in
the morning General Joshua L. Chamberlain of Maine,
having asked for the services of his old Brigade, the Third,
had the same ranged in line to receive the oncoming
Southrons. "It was not long before a column of gray was
seen marching down the valley which sent a thrill of excitement
through every individual present. The Union troops
were brought to attention. Evans' Brigade of Gordon's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
Corps led the advance of the Confederates. As its head
reached the extreme right of Chamberlain's line, it was
wheeled into company line first and subsequently into
general line confronting the Union troops. Then each
regiment stacked arms, unslung cartridge boxes and hung
them on the stacks, and finally laid down their colors.
It was a trying scene. And then, disarmed and colorless,
they again broke into column and marched off, disappearing
forever as soldiers of the Southern Confederacy."<a name="FNanchor_X_24" id="FNanchor_X_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_X_24" class="fnanchor">[X]</a></p>

<p>While to the Fifth Corps came the honor of receiving
the formal surrender of the Confederates the fact that the
men had to linger here, at least some of them, until the 15th
brought upon them certain hardships, disagreeable in
spite of their pleasure over the successful ending of the
campaign. For some reason, perhaps the destruction of
bridges on the route, supplies did not reach the army, so
that there was positive suffering on account of lack of food.
Only a few days before, hungry rebel stomachs had been
filled through the foresight and kindness of Grant, and
now the victorious Yankees are experiencing want themselves;
somehow there comes to mind the Scriptural expression,
"He saved others, himself He cannot save."
To crown all, a severe rain fell during the 14th, so without
tents and minus rations, the soldiers passed a miserable
day and night. It was about noon of the 15th, that the
Corps began its retrograde movement, but the rain had
rendered the roads well nigh impassable, hence the course
backward had few of the features of a triumphal procession,
everyone being on the lookout for expected rations,
but none arrived, and after dark came the orders to halt,
break ranks and make the best of the situation for the
night; meanwhile the rain was falling incessantly. The
16th dawned cold and raw and under the circumstances
the men were as comfortable when marching as when
nominally resting. At noon the Appomattox was reached

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
<span class="sidenote smcap">Apr. 14, '65</span>

and, on a temporary bridge it was crossed, and soon after
Farmville was gained, a place more conspicuous in history
than in fact.</p>

<p>Here, at 4 p. m., came the dispatch announcing the death
of President Lincoln and the already discouraged men had
a deeper pitch of woe to bear, naturally the rank and file
of them ascribing the assassination to the Confederate
leaders rather than to a half-crazed actor. It is said that
to properly drape their colors, some of the bearers actually
dipped their handkerchiefs in ink. The next day, Monday,
the 17th, the homeward route was resumed by way of
Burkeville, and on the 21st the Second Brigade encamped
at Blacks &amp; Whites Station on the Southside R. R. Evidently
the Fifth Corps was distributed along the road,
for Powell mentions Sutherland Station, near Petersburg,
as the camping place, reaching the same on the 23d;
and a diarist of the Thirty-ninth, who was at corps headquarters,
places the same at Nottoway Court House.
However placed, in due time the army learned of the
surrender of Johnston in North Carolina on the 26th.
Here too were welcomed back many of the men who were
captured in the Weldon R. R. incident, among them
being Major F. R. Kinsley upon whom devolved the command
of what was left of the Regiment.</p>

<p>We observed May Day by breaking camp and resuming
the march towards the North, passing through Petersburg
on the 3d, taking hurried glances at what had occasioned
us so many months of toil and danger. The James River
was reached at Manchester, just across from Richmond,
so as to pass through the former Capital of the Confederacy
on Saturday, the 6th, taking note in passing of
Libby Prison, Castle Thunder and the State House.
Near the latter to review the Army of the Potomac,
excepting the Sixth Corps, were standing Generals Meade,
Henry Wager Halleck and other officers. The Sixth
Corps was still doing guard duty along the railroad, between
Burkeville and Danville. On the 9th, we pass over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
the famous battlefield of Fredericksburg where Massachusetts
regiments suffered so severely. We cross the
Rappahannock on pontoons below the city, this being
our tenth and last time, and Friday, the 12th of May,
beheld us on Arlington Heights, near Fort Albany and
almost on the very spot of our first camping ground
when, in September, '62, we crossed the Potomac and
entered the enemy's country, thus ending where we
began. What days of wearisome marching, long and
dreary vigils on picket line and vidette, what dangers of
the embattled field the interval covers! The extended
line marks our duties along the Potomac, in Washington,
from Harper's Ferry to Antietam and thence southward
to the Rapidan, with a backward turning to Bull Run
and Thoroughfare Gap, through the Wilderness, Spottsylvania
and Petersburg, the pursuit, surrender and return,
till now the circle is complete. With so much behind us,
what wonder that visions of home become more and
more absorbing!</p>

<p>However, there yet remained the Grand Review for which
in part Sherman's Army had made the trip from North
Carolina, and it was an inspiring sight to see the many
tents of the men who had made the world-famous "March
to the Sea" as they were spread over the heights back of
Alexandria. Very likely the Review was worth all it cost,
but to the men who had to undergo the fatigue incident
to it, there was no little bitter mingled with the sweet;
some even claimed that the exhibition of Tuesday, the
23d, when the Potomac Army marched in review was the
most exacting they had ever taken and they thought it was
for the express and only purpose of gratifying a sightseeing
proclivity of certain authorities well up the line;
Sherman's men paraded on the 24th. The next night,
that of the 25th, there was an illumination by the Army
of the Potomac, candles being lighted on every tent and
rockets were sent up. The brigades turned out, every
man carrying a candle and thus marched to corps head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>quarters,

<span class="sidenote smcap">May 23, '65</span>

where hearty cheers were given for General
Griffin. For the remainder of the month there is little
more than a waiting for the final muster-out and occasional
visits to Washington, Alexandria and other near-by points
of interest.</p>

<p>The coming of June simply intensified the home-longing
and the feeling that we must go very soon. The ceremony
of muster-out began on the 2d, terminating on the 3d, on
whose night comes the statement that we will depart at
8 a. m. of the 4th. According to schedule, we start, the
day being Sunday, and march into Washington and there
wait till 2 p. m., when the train is taken for Baltimore;
the same proved to be a slow one for we do not reach the
city until five o'clock. Then comes the march through
Baltimore, the boarding of another train and an all night's
ride to Philadelphia, arriving in time for a breakfast at
the Cooper Shop, whose hospitality we had tested on our
way southward in September, '62. Thence we ride through
New Jersey to New York city, where a lunch is furnished
by the New England Relief Association, before going on
board a steamer bound for Providence, whence by rail we
reach Boston early in the morning of the 6th. The wait in
Boston is very short and another train transports us to
Readville at 8 a. m. and we are assigned to quarters there.
By a singular coincidence Lieut. Colonel Tremlett who
had been severely wounded at Gravelly Run, March 31st,
and was sent home to Boston, dies this very day in his
Beacon Street home. While passes were readily given to the
homes represented, all were glad to return and receive their
discharges and pay on the 14th of June. Thus ends the
story of devotion and sacrifice of a regiment that had gone
forth to help save the Union and whose members now are
returning to the paths of peace. They have made an honorable
record, not alone pleasing to themselves but to the
hundreds of those to follow and who, in the years to come,
will call their memory blessed.</p>

<p>While men of the Thirty-ninth suffered in nearly all
of the prison-houses of the South, the greater number
spent their periods of confinement in Salisbury, N. C.
The two hundred and thirty-two swept off August 18-19,
'64, at the Weldon R. R., after incarceration at Libby
and Belle Isle, were taken to Salisbury and there spent
the time till their liberation in February, '65. Among the
unfortunates was John H. Eames who was First Sergt.
Co. C, and whose diligent care secured the data concerning
his fellow sufferers which perfected the State House rolls
and gave the boon of certainty to many a stricken home
in the old Bay State. His tabulated statement bears the

<p>In Sergeant Eames' well preserved record, on its final
page, is written,&mdash;"This book I arranged while in prison
from information from the members of the reg't and, to
the best of my knowledge and belief, is strictly true. The
leaves I purloined from the rebel surgeon's hospital book;
the cover I carried through prison, having received it
with, of course, the original leaves through the mail,
Aug. 18, 1864."</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Left Salisbury Prison at seven o'clock, Feb. 20, 1865; cars
started for Greensboro at 8; we rode on top, very cold and slow
riding; arrived at G. (fifty miles) at about 7 a. m. Changed
cars and lay over until 7 p. m. Left for Danville, Va.; slept nearly
all night, reaching D. at daylight; changed cars and started
immediately for Richmond, enjoying the prospect of homeward
bound. Washington's birthday, Feb. 22; arrived in Richmond
about 2 a. m. Waited till 9 a. m. when we were put into Libby
Prison, remaining there till nine o'clock of the following morning.
Then we started by boat down the River, passing safely
through the obstructions; saw two rebel rams, Fort Darling and
other places of interest, reaching the landing (Aiken's) after
two hours' sail, and were received by Yankee cavalry and escorted
to the Yankee truce-boat, some 3 or 4 miles down the river;
passed through the Eighteenth Corps, mostly colored troops,
who used us finely giving us bread, tobacco, etc. On seeing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
good old Flag we felt that we were free again. We got to our
boat all right, except wet feet and some weariness. We soon
got the first drink of Yankee coffee for five months and more;
it tasted splendidly and we got plenty to eat and felt like new
men. We had a safe trip down the river, arriving at Annapolis
Feb. 26, '65; started from Salisbury Prison, Monday; reach
Annapolis Saturday. This journal was written on the way home,
written under difficulties and excitement, and, as a consequence,
is not very minute.</p>

<p>"P. S. Many of the poor fellows who lived to leave prison,
died soon after reaching home so that, at the time Lee surrendered
as far as I could ascertain, four-fifths of those sent to Salisbury
were dead, the remainder being more or less broken in health."</p></div>

    <h2>CORPORAL F. A. GLINES' DIARY.</h2>
</div>


<p>Of the foregoing list, Glines, Horton and Locke, all of
"E," kept diaries or some form of record, as did Corp.
E. H. Lewis of "B," the first two until a few days before
their deaths; Private Locke, after the war, embodied his
recollections in a very interesting lecture, delivered by him
many times. From all of these sources items have been
gleaned through the body of the history and especially
in the following pages. From the carefully preserved diary
of Corporal F. A. Glines extracts are made as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Fri., August 19, 1864&mdash;Lay in line all night; moved a little to
the right; were attacked and flanked and I, with the greater part
of my reg't, was taken prisoner; were taken to Petersburg under
guard; very rainy and muddy.</p>

<p>Sat., 20&mdash;Lay in a field all night; very wet, cold and uncomfortable;
were taken through the town and put on an island, at
the north side of the Appomattox.</p>

<p>Sun., 21&mdash;Lay on the island all day; drew rations for one day;
I had bread and a small piece of pork, full of worms.</p>

<p>Mon., 22&mdash;Were called up at 2 a. m.; left the island at 4; were
put aboard the cars and sent to Richmond; are quartered in
Libby Prison; drew rations for one day, half loaf corn-bread
and a small piece fresh meat.</p>

<p>Tues., 23&mdash;Were sent across the street to another prison; were
searched and all articles of any value were taken from us; were
sent to Belle Isle this afternoon; met John Davis (H) here; am
in the Forty-fifth Squad.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>Wed., 24&mdash;Very hot; are having tents put up for us; we have
two meals a day; quarter loaf of corn bread at 10 a. m. and corn
bread and soup at 3 p. m.; have to sleep on the ground with no
covering.</p>

<p>Thurs., 25&mdash;Very hot and uncomfortable; signs of rain to-night;
had only one meal to-day.</p>

<p>Fri., 26&mdash;Very heavy thunder-shower; last evening several
men tried to escape; do not know how many succeeded; several
shots fired at them; one man killed and three wounded.</p>

<p>Sat., 27&mdash;Sergt. French, Co. G., shot by the guard, one other
man wounded; got our tents to-day.</p>

<p>Sun., 28&mdash;Very hot; were counted this morning.</p>

<p>Mon., 29&mdash;2000 more prisoners sent here this afternoon;
enlarging the space for prisoners.</p>

<p>Thurs., Sept. 8&mdash;My twenty-first birthday; pleasant weather.</p>

<p>Fri., 9&mdash;Were counted to-day; the squads, filled up, stayed outside
nearly all day; took different tents when we came in.</p>

<p>Sat., 10&mdash;Great fire in Manchester last night; great deal of
dispute about tents.</p>

<p>Thurs., Sept. 15&mdash;Those men whose terms of service have expired
were sent for to-day and their names taken; there was
quite a large number of them from nearly all the states.</p>

<p>Fri., 16&mdash;Slept cold last night; a warm day; the guard which
has been guarding us has been relieved by a lot of old cocks who
hardly know a gun from a broomstick; the old guard went off
last night.</p>

<p>Thurs., 22&mdash;A Dutch reb lieutenant in here this afternoon, trying
to enlist Germans in the reb. service; met with poor success,
the boys were too loyal for him; the guard-tents on the hill
removed.</p>

<p>Sun., 25&mdash;A lot of our men went out to-day to work for the
reb government as coopers, carpenters and shoemakers; they
are a small loss to us; the fewer such men the government has,
the better for us.</p>

<p>Mon., 26&mdash;Some of our men building breastworks for the rebs
opposite the camp; it is a pity that they cannot be made to
charge on them with rebs behind the works; did not get anything
to eat till about 2 p. m.</p>

<p>Tues., 27&mdash;John Davis sent to the hospital; a boat load of tents
came over this morning.</p>

<p>Wed., 28&mdash;Counted this morning; two men buried themselves
outside with the intention of escaping, but one of our men told
the Lieutenant, who has kept them in their hole all day buried
up to their necks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<p>Thurs., 29&mdash;Heavy cannonading in the direction of Fort Darling;
some excitement in Richmond; a battery planted opposite
us, across the river; counted to-day; had to stay out nearly all
day; got nothing to eat till evening; was very hungry and faint;
new tents put in place of the old ones.</p>

<p>Fri., 30&mdash;It is six weeks to-day since we were "gobbled" and
about as miserable a six weeks as ever I passed, but "nil desperandum";
670 prisoners sent here to-day, the greater part captured
at Winchester.</p>

<p>Sat., October 1&mdash;Very heavy cannonading in the direction of
Fort Darling; a great deal of excitement in Richmond; the
guards have orders to shoot us if we make any cheering or noisy
demonstration; rained all day, passed a cold, miserable and
comfortless day.</p>

<p>Sun., 2&mdash;Rained nearly all last night; some cannonading this
morning; a man shot by the guard last night; cloudy nearly all
day; the quartermaster and quartermaster sergeant of the
island sent to Castle Thunder for selling rations.</p>

<p>Mon., 3&mdash;Another man shot by the guard this morning; about
200 more prisoners were sent over here this evening from Libby.</p>

<p>Tues., 4&mdash;1100 men were sent away from here this morning;
said to be going further south; they were furnished with two
days' rations.</p>

<p>Wed., 5&mdash;600 more men sent off this morning.</p>

<p>Thurs., 6&mdash;900 of us were turned out at 2 a. m. and furnished
with two days' rations; marched off the island and lay till four
o'clock just off the island, got aboard the cars on the Richmond
and Danville R. R. and started en route for Salisbury, N. C.</p>

<p>Fri., 7&mdash;Rode on the cars all night, reaching Danville at 10
a. m., a most painful ride; we were packed in like herrings;
changed cars and reached Greensboro, N. C, at 10 p. m.; were
marched out into a field for the night; very cold and windy.</p>

<p>Sat., 8&mdash;A very cold night, slept very little; left Greensboro this
morning and reached Salisbury this evening, a very cold ride;
100 men were packed into each car; have drawn no rations since
Thursday morning.</p>

<p>Sun., 9&mdash;We are in a field of about ten acres, we have no
shelter and have to sleep on the ground with no covering, drew
rations this morning. Saw Captain Kinsley and the rest of the
officers; they are in the field with us in log houses, separated
from us by a guard.</p>

<p>Mon., 10&mdash;Did not sleep any last night, it was so cold; drew
rations of half loaf of bread and a pint of boiled rice; 2000 more
men sent here from Belle Isle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<p>Tues., 11&mdash;Slept in the house last night, quite comfortable;
drew only half loaf of bread to-day; two men died last night;
strong talk of paroling; guess it's only "chin."</p>

<p>Wed., 12&mdash;Water very scarce, went outside to-day with some
dippers after water.</p>

<p>Thurs., 13&mdash;Slept in the house last night, slept very cold;
drew rations of hard bread and rice soup to-day; the best rations
we have drawn since we came here.</p>

<p>Sun., 16&mdash;During the night Captain Davis of the 155th New
York Regiment was shot by the guard through the head, he
was killed almost instantly.</p>

<p>Wed., 19&mdash;All the officers sent away this afternoon; 500 more
prisoners sent here this evening from Danville, Va. Have been
a prisoner two months to-day.</p>

<p>Thurs., Nov. 10&mdash;One of our squad fell into the well to-day
and escaped almost miraculously with a sprained shoulder.</p>

<p>Wed., 23&mdash;Cleared off this morning; pleasant but very cold;
Charley Jones died this morning at eight o'clock; Allen died at
2 a. m.</p>

<p>Thurs., 24&mdash;Thanksgiving Day at home; we are on half rations
to-day; a hard Thanksgiving day for us, but better times are
coming, boys, "Wait a little longer!"</p>

<p>Fri., 25&mdash;Made a grand rush for freedom this noon, but we
were driven back by the guard and about twenty-five or thirty
were killed and wounded; we are on half rations again to-day.</p>

<p>Sat., 26&mdash;Phillips died this morning; received a letter from
home this evening. It seems good to hear from the dear ones at
home; it was written Sept. 27.</p>

<p>Mon., 28&mdash;146 colored prisoners came in yesterday from
Richmond; they have been captured about two months.</p>

<p>Tues., 29&mdash;A large number of our men going out to enlist
in the rebel service. I am pretty hard up, but I am bound to
stick to Uncle Sam.</p>

<p>Fri., December 2&mdash;Rather cloudy but comfortable day; full
rations again to-day, bread, meat and rice soup, so I satisfied my
hunger for the first time in a long time.</p>

<p>Tues., 6&mdash;400 more prisoners arrived here yesterday, mostly
cavalry captured in the Valley; 525 men enlisted in the reb
service.</p>

<p>Tues., 13&mdash;350 men enlisted in the reb service to-day; Thompson
of our company went with them; he is the first man to enlist
from our company.</p>

<p>Wed., 14&mdash;Slept in the hospital last night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>Fri., 16&mdash;30 men from our Corps sent in here to-day; three are
from our regiment and bring interesting news from the boys.</p></div>

<p>The entry for the 16th was the last made by the young
man, whose Somerville home was as pleasant and comfortable
as any which that most attractive place afforded;
whose father was fretting at the absence of his son, yet the
latter, putting duty to his country before all others, was
faithful to the end and died on the 6th of January following,
his body sleeping with nearly 13,000 others in a nameless
grave.</p>

    <h2>CORPORAL JOHN E. HORTON'S DIARY.</h2>
</div>


<p>Corporal John E. Horton was a very regular observer
and chronicler of passing events, seldom if ever missing a
day. The following extracts are given, not all that he
wrote but rather where his records add to those already
given from Corporal Glines' entries. A faithful husband
and father, nearly every day has some reference to the wife
and the baby boy in the far away home and on the 21st of
August he laments his inability to get a letter through the
lines to Laura, his wife:</p>

<div class="mt2 blockquot">

<p>Tues., August 23&mdash;(The prisoners are in Libby.) Slept first
rate. Wash up and eat breakfast. They put part of us into
another building opposite; take our names, number of regiment
and where we were born, then search us, take our haversacks,
etc. Give us rations about 1 p. m., take us to Belle Isle; there
are a little over 3,000 of us here. We are divided into squads of
30; Ladd is our Sergeant.</p>

<p>Thurs., 25&mdash;Brown is at work, outside, helping the cook; get
our rations from across the river; attend prayer meeting.</p>

<p>Mon., 29&mdash;About 2100 came from Libby, of the Second Corps;
they were taken the 25th at Ream's Station; am sorry to see
them.</p>

<p>Tues., 30&mdash;Provisions are very high; small loaves of bread are
$5.00 in Confederate money and $1.00 in greenbacks; coffee,
$15.00; sugar, $12.00; onions, $1.00; apples, $2.00 and $3.00.
For $1.00 we get one-fourth of a loaf of bread, a small piece of
bacon and a little bean soup, just enough to keep us alive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>Sat., Sept. 3&mdash;They have stopped the speculation in corn bread.
The Lieutenant says all of it is ours and he will see that we get
it. Write a short letter to Laura; fear she may not get my
letters; there is a prayer meeting every night. I attend and
hope they may do me good.</p>

<p>Sun., October 16&mdash;Sell my ring for $60.00 Confederate money
and buy a blanket for $40.00. Am sorry to part with the ring,
but the blanket will do me more good. A number die every day.</p>

<p>Thurs., 20&mdash;Our rations are bread, molasses and rice soup.</p>

<p>Thurs., 27&mdash;500 more prisoners arrive from Richmond; they
were taken in the Valley and belong to the Sixth, Eighth and
Nineteenth Corps.</p>

<p>Fri., 28&mdash;Twenty-seven died in the last twenty-four hours;
it is sad to see men suffer and die off in this way; my health is
still good; have nothing but rice to-day.</p>

<p>Sat., November 5&mdash;A number take the oath of allegiance to
old Jeff. The Union boys hooted them and kicked one so that
he died; Creedon took the oath.</p>

<p>Tues., 8&mdash;To-day is Election; wish I were at home to vote for
Old Abe. Get no bread or meat, but about a quart of rice soup;
feel hungry and weak.</p>

<p>Wed., 9&mdash;Get some bread; went sixty hours on a little over a
quart of poor rice soup. Felt quite weak and faint, but feel
better since getting some bread; from twenty-five to fifty die
every day.</p>

<p>Fri., 11&mdash;Get bread, meat and soup, but no salt in soup or on
meat, there is none in camp.</p>

<p>Sat., 12&mdash;The long roll was beat three times last night; someone
stoned the guard; have only nine months more to serve.</p>

<p>Mon., 14&mdash;The coldest night of the season thus far; sell a
pair of socks for $5.00 Confederate money and buy some salt
at $1.50 a pint.</p>

<p>Wed., 16&mdash;Rained a little in the night. The papers say Abe
is elected sure.</p>

<p>Fri., 18&mdash;Help take Allen of the Fourth New Hampshire to
the hospital; think he cannot live long. It is a sad sight to see how
the men are dying off.</p>

<p>Sun., 20&mdash;This does not seem like the Sabbath; little Orren is
seventeen months old; wish I were at home to see him.</p>

<p>Mon., 21&mdash;Rheumatism troubles me some; Allen of the
Fourth New Hampshire died last night.</p>

<p>Sat., 26&mdash;Get a letter from Laura dated Oct. 2d, and another
this afternoon, dated August 27th; they are all well; am very
glad to hear from them. Phillips (E) died last night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<p>Mon., 28&mdash;The Rebs count every division at the same time
to stop flankers; have an attack of diarrhea.</p>

<p>Tues., 29&mdash;370 take oath of allegiance to Jeff and go into the
rebel army; short rations and so many dying urge them to this
step; diarrhea a little worse.</p>

<p>Wed., 30&mdash;Am some better; this is my thirty-fifth birthday;
hope to be able to spend my next at home. It is a real Indian
Summer day. P. Merrill of the First Massachusetts Cavalry
died in our tent. The chimney in the hospital fell, killing one
man and wounding several.</p>

<p>Thurs., December 1&mdash;A fine day for the first of winter; am
much better; sold my rations and bought some bread flour;
Locke gave me some pills.</p>

<p>Fri., 2&mdash;It is just fifteen weeks since I was taken prisoner, am
in strong hopes of being exchanged soon; feel about well.</p>

<p>Sun., 4&mdash;Could hear the church bells and it made me feel homesick;
how I wish I could be at home with my wife and boy.</p>

<p>Sat., 10&mdash;Stormed all night; about three inches of snow fell;
a cold, bad night for us prisoners, but I managed to keep warm.
Gorham (E) died this morning about two o'clock; he was sick
but a short time.</p>

<p>Mon., 12&mdash;It froze hard, very cold for those who have no
blankets. General Winder and some other rebel officers were
here to inspect the condition of the prisoners. Am some better
to-day, got wheat flour.</p>

<p>Fri., 16&mdash;A few more Yankee prisoners come in, three of the
Thirty-ninth, one (Burns) from "B" and one (Hemmenway)
from "K," captured last Sunday (11), near Weldon. Sorry to
see them here, but glad to hear from the regiment.</p>

<p>Thurs., 22&mdash;Drew bread, syrup and soup, no meat for a long
time.</p>

<p>Sun., 25&mdash;Cloudy, with raw, cool wind; a dull Christmas for
me. We got one-half a loaf of bread and a little rice soup for our
Christmas dinner, breakfast and supper; wish I were at home,
but see little signs of an exchange.</p>

<p>Wed., 28&mdash;Tipton was elected our squad sergeant in place of
White (deposed); our tent run for Haun, but he got beat; think
we have a good sergeant. Rumor says there is to be a general
exchange of prisoners the first of January; hope it is true.</p>

<p>Thurs., 29&mdash;Rained quite hard all night and our tent leaked
some; do not feel very well but hope I shall not be sick.</p>

<p>Fri., 30&mdash;A cool, dull day. Have the diarrhea quite bad, but
am in hopes to get rid of it soon. John Locke gave me some pills.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span></p>

<p>Sat., 31&mdash;Rained about all day; comes on cold and snows
some. Had the diarrhea very bad all night; a cold, dull,
disagreeable day for the very last of 1864. It looks like a dark
prospect ahead for us prisoners, but I am in hopes to be exchanged
soon; so the story runs.</p>

<p>Sun., January 1, 1865&mdash;A fine pleasant morning but cool. It
does not look like a very happy New Year for me, but am in
hopes to get out of this soon. God grant it may be a happy and
pleasant one to my wife and boy. Am a little better this morning.</p></div>

<p>Five days later the hand that wrote the foregoing and
that had given daily evidence of its fealty to God, home and
country, in devotion to duty and in a daily record of deed
and thought, was cold in death, for on the 6th of January
Horton died and what was mortal of him was borne out to
the trenches to rest with the more than two score of his
comrades of the Thirty-ninth who had gone the sad way
before him. And thus perished almost 40,000 loyal men,
faithful to the end and, "When the Roll is Called up Yonder,"
it seems highly probable that the most of those, who thus
endured cold, hunger and every form of privation in token
of their appreciation of duty, will stand a fairly good
chance of being able to answer "Here."</p>

    <h2>FROM DIARY OF CORPORAL EDWARD H. LEWIS, CO. B.</h2>
</div>


<p>As the Corporal's record goes over the same time and
place of other diarists, care is taken to avoid repetitions.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Salisbury, the last of October&mdash;The death rate is heavy, owing
to bad weather and small rations; the latter also being poor in
quality, consisting of what is supposed to be coarsely ground
corn meal, including a great deal of the cob. It is mixed with hot
water, no salt or seasoning of any kind, and baked in large
loaves, about three inches thick and these loaves are cut into
squares of about three and one-half inches, the same being a
ration for twenty-four hours. In addition to this we have been
having about three-quarters of a pint of something called "soup."
It is made of North Carolina peas (usually called "cow-peas"),
decayed bacon very active with maggots, and water, the process<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
of brewing being as follows: A large kettle receives its bushels
of peas, along with its due proportion of the said animated bacon
and the necessary liquid, and the combination is boiled until the
outer cuticle of the pea is loosened, scarcely longer, and then is
dipped out for the sustenance of Yankee unfortunates. Were
this all, it would not be so bad, but the foam which appears upon
the surface of the soup is very far from being unsubstantial, since
therein float hundreds of the vermicular denizens of peas and
bacon. Not exactly as appetizing as the bouillon of home preparation
nor as clear, yet with closed eyes and bated breath, we
manage to enclose it, probably to our bodily good, if not to the
satisfaction of our several senses.</p>

<p class="mt2">Nov. 10&mdash;Charles Wadsworth, Company B, dies to-day.</p>

<p>Nov. 24&mdash;Many of the boys suffering from hunger, thirst and
general exposure, took the oath of allegiance to the Confederacy
to-day, thinking by so doing to find an opportunity to escape
and reach our lines; fully three hundred have done this during the
month of November.</p>

<p>Nov. 25&mdash;The attempt to break out of prison to-day was unsuccessful.
The prisoners were divided into three divisions, the
first being called the Wood Division, since it was expected to
make the attack on the big gates where wagons bring in our
wood; the second division was to break through the bakeries,
while the third was to spike the pieces of artillery that were
trained upon the enclosure; mine was the Bread Division and in
the effort we lost six killed and ten wounded.</p>

<p>Nov. 27&mdash;James Kilduff, Co. B, dies to-day.</p>

<p>Dec. 5&mdash;Was asked to enlist in the Confederate army and thus
escape this terrible suffering. I replied most positively that I
would stand by the old Flag if I died here.</p>

<p>Dec. 27&mdash;My shoes, such as they were, were stolen last night
and I am barefooted. Could only wrap my feet in rags which I
picked up in small pieces. Three rebel Catholic priests came
into the prison to-day and tried to influence our Catholic boys
to serve in the Confederate army and succeeded in getting many
of them.</p>

<div class="chapter">
    <h2>JOHN F. LOCKE'S RECOLLECTIONS.</h2>
</div>


<div class="blockquot">

<p>'Twas a gloomy march from the immediate rear of the Confederate
Army to Petersburg and a weary night that was spent
in the yard of the penitentiary of that town. In the morning
we were relieved of all military equipments such as knapsacks,
haversacks, canteens, etc., and also all blankets, shelter-tents,
overcoats, or extra clothing.... The next day we were
removed to an island in the Appomattox and the rain, setting in,
rendered the night hideous enough. The boys gathered in
squads and, sitting back to back, on the damp, spongy ground,
tried to sleep but, with such a hapless present and such a hopeless
future, few could enjoy that luxury.</p>

<p>The next day the whole 1800 were escorted out of town about
two miles, that we might take the cars for Richmond. Three
hard-tacks (the first food received from our captors' hands) were
given us to make us hungry and that we might enjoy our excursion.
The sound of the battle in progress (the 21st) on the same
ground where we were captured was plainly heard, and we could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
but wish that the results might be more favorable than those of
the 19th.... Towards the last of the afternoon we
arrived in Richmond and as we alighted from the coal cars we
were told that only one hotel in the place could accommodate us
and that one was "The Libby" and, as we were strangers in
town and might wish to look around a little, we were escorted
through some of the principal streets.</p>

<p>Finally the procession brought up in front of Libby and we were
stowed away in it; thus in nine of its rooms were packed 1800
men. We spent a portion of our time in examining our new
quarters, the walls of which were covered with the names of former
fellow sufferers. Here we received our first half loaf of
corn bread which was not so bad in quality as it was in quantity.
Then came orders from the Prison Inspector, Dick Turner, to
hand over all moneys to him for safe keeping, and some unsophisticated
ones obeyed, having their names duly registered,
but I have not heard that Turner gave any receipt or that anything
ever came back. After a very uncomfortable night, owing to
our crowded condition, we were glad to see the morning and
soon afterward we were taken across the street (Carey) to Pemberton
prison and distributed in its rooms in squads of twenty-five.
Turner soon came in and, in his insolent, arrogant style,
ordered us to strip ourselves that our clothes might be searched,
for he was not satisfied with the amount already given up.
Stripped naked, and with our clothing a few paces in front of us,
we saw our garments searched for valuables.</p>

<p>Our wallets, watches, jackknives, rings and everything of
comfort or value that was not absolutely necessary was gathered
into a heap and Turner, with greedy eye, not only inspected but
appropriated. At the end of a long half hour we were permitted
to dress and then were conducted back to Libby, and other squads
followed, the procession continuing till well into the next day,
everyone being pretty thoroughly plucked. After all, many of
the cunning Yankees were able to circumvent the rebels, since
bills of large denominations were hidden in such queer places as
ears, mouth and hair, thus enabling the possessor to procure
needed comforts in coming days.</p>

<p>Having been, in this manner, completely robbed, we were
formed in line for Belle Isle; as the dismal name was sounded our
spirits fell, for we had heard the stories of suffering there, but to
Belle Isle we went and were conducted to one corner, containing
about an acre and a half of ground, enclosed by a low breastwork
and a deadline. This part of the island was so low that the
spring freshets invariably covered it. The soil is composed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
largely of sand and is prolific of fleas, bugs and other kinds of
insects too disagreeable to mention. The place was extremely
hot by day and, through its lowness, cold by night; alternately
roasted and all but frozen we passed seven miserable weeks upon
Belle Isle, but why thus named beautiful we could never imagine.</p>

<p>For three weeks we were without shelter, then came six good
A tents for every squad of one hundred men. When it rained or
was colder than usual, we were wont to lower the tent upon us,
using it as a blanket; here we would lie and all but smother till
the call for rations was sounded the next morning at about nine
o'clock. Our rations consisted of a piece of corn bread, 5 x 2-1/2 in.
in size and a small piece of rancid bacon or boiled fresh beef.
Towards three in the afternoon a half pint of soup, composed of
wormy beans, was issued and, though the hogs of the keeper
usually tasted it first, we relished it and were glad to get it.
While we thought this pretty hard fare, the time was to come
later when we looked back upon these days as those of comparative
plenty.</p>

<p>By new arrivals our numbers were soon swollen to fully 6,000
men, among them being a portion of a regiment of Germans so
new to the country that they were unacquainted with our language,
hence a deal of trouble for them, as in their ignorance
they would wander over the dead line after a chip for fuel, but
they never returned. During the day we were permitted to go
to the water, through a narrow passage, as often as we pleased,
but at night only five were permitted to go at a time. A sergeant
(H. C. French) of Co. G, our regiment, having taken his
turn, was coming back and of course there was a rush to be the
next one to go down, by the boys in the yard, and in their haste
they pushed the sergeant, who was quite weak from illness, into
the ditch of the dead line. Without a word of warning he was
instantly shot dead by one of the sentries, the bullet passing
through his head. This sentinel was a young fellow of sixteen
years who, with his mother, while living near Mitchell's Station
had been supplied with food during the whole of the previous
winter by the commissary of our Brigade. We were told that he
was paid for this act of ingratitude by a two weeks' furlough home.</p>

<p>An incident will illustrate the straits to which the lack of food
will drive otherwise decent men. We were counted regularly
once a week, usually on Saturdays, the object being to find out
whether any were escaping. To effect this numbering we were
filed out, one by one, into a vacant lot which bordered on the
river. While here one day, several of the boys completely buried
themselves in the sand, hoping to get away from the island in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
following night. No loss was suspected on our return but, during
the afternoon, a poor hungry wretch went to the gate and, calling
for the sergeant of the guard, offered to reveal something of
importance if he would give him a loaf of bread. The rebel
agreed, whereupon he was shown where the Yankees were concealed
in the sand. It is only fair for the sergeant to state that
he knocked the informer down with the butt of his musket,
saying that if he were as mean as that, he would go and kill
himself.</p>

<p>The Confederate mode of punishing petty offenses among us
was most cruel. The culprit was placed astride a tall, carpenter's
horse, some six feet in height, and ropes were tied to his feet,
fastened to the ground and then drawn as taut as possible; his
hands were fastened behind him and tied to the horse. In this
condition the unhappy sufferer was obliged to pass three or
four hours; most always they were taken down insensible and
some of them never recovered from this brutal usage. On the
5th of October came orders to be ready to march. Joyfully we
obeyed, confident that our destination was the land of the Stars
and Stripes, though rations of a loaf and a half of corn bread
clearly pointed in another direction, our halting place being on
the south side of the James where, by the side of the Richmond
and Danville R. R., we lay all day eating our three days' rations.
At 5 p. m. a train of baggage cars drew up and the painful fact
dawned upon us that we were simply going to exchange one
prison for another.</p>

<p>So closely were we packed, lying or sitting was out of the
question and all had to stand. We reached Salisbury, N. C.,
three days after leaving Belle Isle, and in the evening of the 8th
we were turned into the prison enclosure where we saw very little
to invite us, though the place was comparatively clean then.
The light of fires revealed the shivering forms of unhappy prisoners
who had preceded us to this place of detention. It was
one of the coldest of autumnal nights and we came so late no
provision had been made for us, so, hungry as we were after fasting
two days, tired and cold, we faced the uncomfortable night.
Worn out with hunger and fatigue, we threw ourselves on the
frozen ground with no covering save the heavens, which were
very cold that night; dressed, the most of us, in summer blouses
with no underclothing, it was one continuous shiver till the rising
sun gladdened our eyes and warmed our bodies. We lay down
close to each other but, as the night grew colder and the wind
whistled more sharply, the end men with one side exposed,
unable to endure the cold longer, would leave for some fire or
exercise till at last the entire line would dwindle away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>

<p>A day's ration of half a loaf of wheat bread and a nice slice of
meat put us in proper condition to examine our quarters. The
field comprised about seven acres, somewhat triangular in shape
with a twelve-foot-high board-fence surrounding it, on whose
outside, about four feet from the top, was a continuous platform for
the sentries. Facing the entrance were three little brick houses
about 30 x 15 and at their right, at right angles, were three
other similar buildings; in one corner stood a large brick edifice,
formerly a cotton factory, now called the penitentiary, adjoining
which was the prison cook-house; near by were two wooden
buildings, one a hospital, the other occupied by citizen prisoners;
of the large structure, three rooms were occupied by deserters
from our army, and two others by rebel deserters, than whom a
more graceless lot I never saw. On the north side of the prison-yard
and back of the brick buildings were four wooden shanties,
built of rough timbers and occupied by our officers who were
captured when we were, separated from us only by the beat and
bayonet of the sentinel.</p>

<p>Wood was brought in and distributed in a very peculiar manner,
since everybody attacked the load at once and to the strong went
the major part of the fuel, while the weaker men had to suffer.
On our arrival, the whole enclosure was covered with grass, but
it soon disappeared. Meanwhile the days were growing colder
and our appetites keener; on our way hither I had sold the stockings
off my feet for a boiled beet, now I exchanged a good pair of
pantaloons for a miserable rebel pair and five dollars, Confederate
scrip, and though my blouse was about worn out I felt as
happy as a lark in so doing, for by the proceeds I was able to buy
another pair of socks and had enough money left for little extras
of food for a week or ten days. There were only three wells in
the enclosure (four more were dug later) which yielded hardly
water enough for drink, thus putting bathing entirely out of the
question. There being no bucket for drawing the water, we
supplied its place by our tin cups, which we lowered with strings
made from suspenders and bootlegs. Through constant dipping
the wells were transformed into mudholes, so that a nominal quart
of water was really one-fourth red clay.</p>

<p>Made desperate by the prospects of the coming winter, a plan
for an escape was formed to be led by General Joseph Hayes
(formerly Colonel Eighteenth Massachusetts Volunteers commanding
First Brigade, Second Division, Fifth Corps; captured
at the Weldon R. R.) but discovery of the plot resulted in the
removal of the officers to Danville, Va., and the collapse of the
scheme. For the distribution of food the prisoners were divided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
into divisions of one thousand each and these into squads of one
hundred, each one being looked after by a sergeant from its own
numbers. About the 1st of November tents were issued, two to
a squad, ours receiving for one the fly of an officer's tent, the
other a small McClellan, the two affording protection for only
a small part of the squad, and those who got any good from them
were the immediate friends of the sergeant. All others had
to seek cover under ground which they secured by digging holes,
somewhat larger than those of woodchucks, but of the same
general nature. Pitiable indeed was the condition of the men by
this time, since the heavy rains had turned the whole enclosure
into a veritable pig-sty whose soft red clay could be made into
bricks without further mixing.</p>

<p>The death-rate increased at an alarming rate, so that from
forty to fifty were carried out each day to the dead-house.
Nearly all of the workshops had been changed into hospitals,
also two floors of the old factory building. The dead-house
was one of the lower floors of one of the work-shops where, when
the weather was bad and the dead were not readily removed, as
many as eighty corpses, stark and cold, could be seen piled one
upon the other like corded wood. On the coming of the cart to
remove them, they were thrown into the same with the least
formality possible and so carried off. As we had no means of
bathing, one of the worst features of the yard was the mass of
animated insect life. Oh! the horrors of such creatures! Through
them it might be said that we suffered a thousand deaths. Never
at rest, always vigorous, they inhabited every nook and crevice
of that dismal yard. They were worse than death. The terrors
of a Spanish Inquisition could not bring to bear a mode of torture
so vile as these filthy vermin.</p>

<p>Then the state of the yard! The principal diseases were dysentery
and pneumonia, so that disease bred corruption and malaria.
Those who were taken sick, if their squad sergeant were attentive,
were carried to Hospital No. 3, and if, on examination, it
were evident that the ailment was incurable, he was sent to a
hospital to die. The good wheat bread of our earlier rations was
changed to corn bread, made of the coarsest cob meal and given
to us with rancid molasses. Meat was issued, after a time, about
once in fifteen days and then at the rate of eight pounds of beef
and bones to a hundred men. At such times all parts of the
creatures were used; the heads with eyes and horns still attached
were often issued and in some way made victuals of. All small
bones capable of being chewed were swallowed as a dog gulps his
osseous food and the larger and harder ones were crushed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
stones and boiled for hours; the soup thus obtained was thought a
great luxury. To obtain salt a day's ration would be exchanged
for enough of this necessity to last a fortnight or so, of course the
exchange meant a fast for the day whose ration was traded.</p>

<p>Occasionally flour or meal was given us in the raw and without
salt; this was cooked into paste and gruel and very thankful
all were to get it; oftentimes the prisoners were kept on one-half
the regular rations, possibly one-quarter of the time, and sometimes
we went as many as three days with no bread whatever.
It was this starvation process that drove good men to enlist in
the southern army. About the 12th of November a thick cup of
rice soup was given out; the next and the following day, we got
only rice water, then came flour without salt. Wood was now
issued regularly, each squad getting four sticks of eight foot
timber. This particular afternoon it was green pine. To add to
our troubles a mist arose, so that the only way we could cook our
food was by piling the logs on top of each other and placing a coal
underneath which we took turns in keeping alive with our breath,
till all had cooked their meal. It was a hapless sight that we
afforded that afternoon, black with dirt and smoke, as we ate our
food. We had gone so long without food that we had almost
lost the sense of hunger and this little meal only served to wake
our appetite. Before eating my ration, I could walk about the
yard without resting; afterwards I was so weak that I fainted in
going to my tent, for I was failing rapidly; my old pantaloons
were worn out and slit from the knee downward; the sleeves of
my shirt and blouse were almost gone, my shoes and socks worn
through, my hair matted with dirt and filth, my complexion
that of a negro, my body truly was more dead than alive.</p>

<p>My condition was that of my associates in misery, and it was
then that the rebel authorities opened a recruiting station in our
midst, offering a loaf of bread and fifty dollars in gold to each
one who would enlist; six hundred went out. With the exception
of a few desperate characters, all hearts were softened at the
sight of so much misery, the faint hearted had mostly enlisted
in the rebel ranks and those who remained were true blue and
had determined, live or die, to stand fast to their principles.
Without anything being said, oaths began to be dropped and
testaments to be read; while cant was never so ridiculous and
intolerable, true religion and a pure morality began to be the life
of the mass.</p>

<p>About the last of November, a friend with whom I had become
acquainted on Belle Isle was appointed wardmaster of Hospital
No. 5; hearing of my condition, he sent for me. I went and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
received like a brother, the dirt washed from me, there being
plenty of water in the hospitals, clothes taken from men who
had died were given me and I was nursed, cared for and fed out of
his own rations till my life, which was slowly ebbing away, was
coaxed back again. This friend, a total stranger before my capture,
was a sergeant in a Pennsylvania cavalry regiment and
our acquaintance began at a devotional meeting where were laid
the foundations of the strongest Christian friendship. He was a
veritable ministering angel to all those who came under his care,
and from his conduct I learned that Christianity was not merely
a sentiment but a life, not an idea but a reality.</p>

<p>As remarked before, few cases were admitted to the hospital
that were not considered hopeless; from our ward of two rooms,
having forty patients, five or six would be carried to the dead-house
every night. Army surgeons are bad enough anywhere,
but those provided at Salisbury were worse than the common
run. Coming in at the time appointed, they never came at any
other, they would go along the line of men lying on the floor,
hitting the patient with their feet to attract attention, would
contemptuously inquire, "Well, what's the matter with you
to-day?" and, without waiting for a reply, would prescribe any
one of the medicines that happened to cross their minds. There
were, indeed, three honorable exceptions, but they could only express
their sympathy by words of encouragement. Our ward
doctor, the most of the time, was a medical student of the latter
class.</p>

<p>November 25th came a decided effort to break out; unfortunately
the plot had not been worked up so that a sufficient number
understood the plan, so that the effort was made at two instead
of four o'clock, when only three divisions had been prepared.
On the appearance of the relief at that time, someone gave the
watchword, "Who's for liberty?" and, as quick as a flash, every
one of those sentinels was disarmed and the boys were using their
guns against the sentinels on the fence. The noise of the struggle
of course soon brought the troops to the scene and forming on the
fence began firing. If theirs had been the only resistance, we
might have succeeded; unfortunately for us, the Sixty-ninth
North Carolina, a newly recruited regiment, was just outside,
awaiting transportation, and they were brought to the support
of the guards, and many of the Salisbury citizens, afraid of their
property if we got away, trotted down with their fowling pieces
and old flintlocks. The fence was soon covered with enemies who
began a murderous fire on every tent in the yard, though not a
third part of the prisoners knew what was up until it was too late<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
and then, recognizing the hopelessness of the effort, everyone tried
to hide himself from the terrible fire. The guards having recovered
from their fright proceeded to exercise vengeance by
discharging the two pieces of artillery loaded with boiler screws
amongst us. No one knows how many were killed, but sixty or
seventy were wounded, most of them lying in their tents. The
wounded were all placed in the same hospital, were all treated with
the same surgical tools and gangrene set in with all, and all,
save two or three, died.</p>

<p>Of my company (E) twenty-four were captured, the most of
them strong healthy men. As the winter advanced and the cold
grew more intense, many of them lost hope and dropped away.
From my position in the hospital, to which I had been elected
after recovering sufficient strength, I was able to be of help to
them. I passed out crust-coffee and opium pills whenever I
could get them. The stoutest hearted man in the company was
the first to die. A native of Maine, a blacksmith by trade, Jones
seemed the one best fitted to endure hardship, yet, allowing himself
to become disheartened, he quickly fell a prey to disease.
On one of my visits to the boys I found one of them, a corporal
(Glines), failing fast. I asked permission of the superintendent to
admit him to the hospital as a patient and it was granted. Two
days later, I heard that another corporal (Horton) of my company,
a near neighbor and friend at home, wished to see me.
I found him lying in the mud of his tent, and I knew by the look
of his face that he could not live. He asked me if I could do anything
for him or, at least, give him some opium. I got some of
the pills for him and told him I would do what I could towards
getting him into the hospital. Knowing that he could not live
much longer he said, "Tell the folks at home I died trying to do
my duty and thinking of them." Going back to the ward, I
besought the privilege of bringing him to the hospital. The
superintendent replied that there was no vacancy, but would be
on the morrow, but I might go after supper and get him and give
him a place under a bunk. I went upstairs and cooked our scanty
meal and, while doing so, the night patients were brought in.
While eating my supper, one of the nurses, a pompous fellow,
came in and said that one of the patients was a young fellow who
insisted on seeing me before going under his bunk. On being told
that I was busy upstairs the nurse said he whined, "I wish you
would call Johnnie, one moment," but he put a stop to his "nonsense,"
as the nurse said, by showing him his place for the night
and said that he had fainted in taking it. Indignant that my
friend had been denied so small a favor, I hurried down to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
place where he had been put and cried, "Fred," and, as no
answer came I supposed him asleep and thought I would not
disturb him. After finishing my work at midnight, I went upstairs
to retire; shortly afterward the nurse in attendance called
that a corporal, under the bunks, was dead. Hurrying down, I
found my friend stiff and cold in death in the middle of the floor.
A friend and playmate from boyhood, the merriest boy of us all,
smart in school, most joyous in sport, he was the life of our
youthful circle. We had enlisted together; his parents, brothers
and sisters were all well known to me and I must tell the sad
story to them&mdash;how he had died in a hospital of which I was an
attendant, yet had been unable to comfort him in his dying
hours. The sight of my grief was a good lesson to the nurses who
were more ready to grant favors thereafter. Horton, the other
corporal, died the same night.</p>

<p>A great many died from the effects of the cold weather; numbers
of them had their feet frost-bitten and, as they were not taken care
of, mortification set in, to be followed by death. Many a poor
fellow, weak with disease, left his tent at night, and, stumbling
in the darkness would fall and being too weak to call for help
would be found in the morning a frozen corpse. Finally, without
any warning, on the to us ever memorable 20th of February, '65,
orders came to have the sick ready for removal. It was with
joyful hearts that we obeyed and, when the gate was opened that
we might carry them out, we could hardly contain ourselves for
joy. Only when the cars had fully started could we realize that
Salisbury, with its filth and dirt, its misery and degradation, its
dying and dead, was being left for good. With feeble voices we
sang "Praise God from Whom all Blessings Flow" and many a
prayer of thanksgiving was breathed that we had lived to see the
glad hour.</p></div>

    <h2>SERGT. MAJOR C. K. CONN</h2>
</div>


<p>Sergt. Major Chas. K. Conn, originally of Company K,
was wounded May 8, '64, captured and carried to Richmond.
After recovering from his wounds he was retained
as a clerk, one of his duties being to make out the lists of
those who were to be paroled. Having a happy thought
one day while preparing a roll of names, he wrote his
own among those of men about to start for God's country,
and when the party in charge called for those thus enu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>merated,
Conn stepped forth with the invalids to whom
parole privileges were confined in 1864. One of the Confederate
officers, noticing him among the sick men, asked
him what he was doing there. To the query the quick
witted Yankee replied, "I heard my name called and so
responded." The facts in the case were not discovered
till after Conn had gone too far to be called back, though
he felt extremely shaky until he was safely aboard the
Union vessel.</p>

<div class="chapter">
    <h2>J. F. LESLIE'S RUSE</h2>
</div>


<p>This Company K man thought his liberty worth risking
something for; captured Aug. 19, '64, he too had been
taken to Richmond, "Libby" and Belle Isle, where he
informed his comrades he purposed trying the sick
dodge by way of the hospital, for he had discerned that
the sick and wounded would go first. His friends tried
to dissuade him, saying that he would surely be found
out and might be made to suffer all the more on account
of his attempted cheat. He tried the rebel doctor every
morning with his complaints, but was careful to take
none of the latter's medicine, throwing all of it away.
At last the surgeon, suspecting shamming on the Yankee's
part, prepared a Spanish-fly plaster, 4 x 8 inches in size,
which could not be disposed of as his medicine had been.
Leslie put it on his body, keeping it on all night, and
when he visited the doctor in the morning and was asked
if it had had any effect he was able to show a blister the
full size of the plaster. This convinced the officer that
our man was not shamming, for as he said, "Any man who
could stand that could not be 'playing it'," so he was
sent to the hospital in Richmond, "Yankee, 21," as it
was called. On getting there he hardly dared move for
fear of being sent back. One morning the hospital doctor,
saying that he would give him something to make him
sleep, left a potion with the injunction to make sure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
that it was taken; there was no way open but to take it,
but it was spat out the moment the steward passed to the
next patient. The look of astonishment on the doctor's
face the next morning convinced the patient that it was
a dose for final sleep that the surgeon had prepared; at
any rate he never came near Leslie's cot again. In a few
days the "artful dodger" was paroled, while his comrades
were sent to Salisbury and Andersonville where the most
of them died.</p>

    <h2>CORPORAL CHARLES H. BARNES' STORY.</h2>
</div>


<p>A picture of Andersonville, as it appeared in the summer
and fall of 1864 and the following winter, is drawn by
Corporal Charles H. Barnes of Co. I, who was wounded
the 8th of May and, two weeks later, while going from
Fredericksburg to Belle Plain Landing, on his way with
others to Washington and Convalescent Camp, was captured,
carried to Richmond and shut up in Libby Prison,
where he passed through the usual experience of being
searched, etc. Three weeks later in company with more
than a thousand fellow prisoners, he was started for
Andersonville, Georgia; having ninety of them in an
ordinary box car was pretty close work, since they could
neither sit nor lie down, so had to stand. At Goldsboro
they were unloaded and like cattle turned into a pasture
without supper or shelter, but unlike cattle they could not
eat the grass about them; rain was falling hard and, wet
to the skin, they had to stand closely together for the sake
of warmth. Starting again in the morning they reached
Andersonville, just a week after leaving Richmond, the
cars running only about three miles an hour, any greater
speed being provocative of accident:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I was wearing a pair of boots that came to me from home the
day I was taken prisoner and I hated to part with them, but I
got so hungry when on the cars that I traded them with one of
the guards for a dozen biscuits and a pair of old shoes full of
holes. I ate the biscuits pretty quick, and still was as famished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
as before, and I wished I had the boots back to trade again. We
were told that it was a lovely place inside of the stockade, but
we found it quite the reverse. There were 39,000 men within
the enclosure living in holes and tents made of pieces of old
shirts, blankets and anything they could get that would hold
together. When we marched in, we had to stand a while before
assignment to some place in which to stay, when some of the
men, already initiated, said that we had better be looking for
places to camp in, we having thought that some sort of shelter
would be given us. So we hunted around and found a soft bit
of earth which some fifteen of us occupied; ere long some of the
old timers came round to see if we had anything they might wish.
On waking, the next morning, each man found his pocket cut,
but the thieves got nothing, since every man was dead broke.</p>

<p>There were two stockades, one inside the other, about twenty
feet apart and as many feet high in most places; along the top
were shelters for the guard and about twelve feet from the inner
wall was the dead line. It was made of scantling nailed on the
top of posts, about four feet in height and if a prisoner touched
it, which he was quite likely to do, the guards would shoot him
if they could. A small brook ran through the middle of the yard;
sluggish generally, it became a raging torrent after severe rains.
One day some of the stockade fell over into the water and some
of the prisoners swam out to the floating logs and so raced out to
freedom, for they were going too rapidly to be recaptured. For
our first twenty days it rained nearly all the time and the only
cover our party had was a piece of an old blanket, which as many
as possible would put over their heads while the rest ran around
trying to keep warm until the time came to exchange, an all day
and all night series.</p>

<p>After some searching I found four members of my own regiment,
they having a tent made of old shirts and parts of old blankets
which they had pinned together with broken sticks. Three
of the boys could scarcely move on account of the scurvy, but
one of them asked me to come in and stay with them, which I
was glad to do, though I had to lie at their feet until one of them
passed on, only a few days later. Shortly afterwards the other
ones died and two of the Thirty-ninth had what was left which,
while it did not keep out the rain, did keep off the direct sun, a
no small comfort in that terribly hot place. We had two half
pieces of blankets, nearly used up and almost covered with what
Robert Burns called "crawlin' ferlies," the fearful pests of our
lives. I undertook one day to wash my shirt, trying first one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
corner of it which went to pieces, so I dried the garment carefully
and without further effort at washing wore it almost nine months.</p>

<p>First and last many tunnels were dug, in several of which I
bore a hand; I don't know how many succeeded in getting out
but there must have been several hundred; bloodhounds were
put on their track and those who were brought back were put in
the chain-gang. Among so many men there must be some bad
ones, a few very bad; they even resorted to murder in their efforts
to secure what some of the prisoners possessed. To rid themselves
of this terrible set of evil men a vigilance committee of the well
disposed was organized and by sheer force of numbers, overpowered
and sentenced to death six of them. The rebels, to their
credit, furnished material for the gibbet and the execution took
place, much to the relief of those who had to continue there.</p>

<p>Our drinking water came from holes in the ground four or five
feet deep; while it was pretty clear, there were many dead maggots
in the bottom, though we did not mind them, thinking the
water so much better than that in the brook. One day in August
a stream of water broke out just inside of the inner stockade; it
ran all of the time, but the dead line was between us and the
water; we procured boards and made a trough and then got permission
to put it up, so that we had fine water all the rest of the
time we were there. To this day it is known as the Providence
Spring. Aside from scurvy, severe enough to loosen my teeth, I
was not sick a day while in the prison. Our rations for the most
part were a pint of boiled rice without any salt for twenty-four
hours and oftener it would be forty-eight, for every time Captain
Wirz discovered a new tunnel he would punish all of us by skipping
our rations. Occasionally we would get some small black
beans, such as the planters raised for their hogs; these we would
try to cook with green pitch-pine with results that can be imagined.
I have blown myself black in the face many a time trying
to cook them and then had to eat them raw.</p>

<p>There was a sick call every day and when a man answered the
same, all he got for his pains was a dose of sumach berries. No
matter what the complaint might be the remedy was always
the same, for it was all they had to give. Sometimes a man
could be seen buried up to his chin; he had the rheumatism and
if he could endure the antidote two or three days, he would
come out cured. One boy, to get some extra food, told the
captain one day where a new tunnel was in progress, and after
the officer had gone out, the men shaved one side of his head and
on his breast and back put big placards, bearing in big black
letters the word "Traitor." He was then marched all over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
camp and tormented almost to death; the enemy finally took
him outside, which was just what he wanted.</p>

<p>After Stoneman's raid, the rebels thinking Andersonville no
longer safe began to distribute us elsewhere and I sampled the
bull-pen of Savannah, Ga.; the stockade of Millen, also in
Georgia; and then was sent back to Savannah where I was paroled
and sent down the River, to go on board a Union steamer; the
sight of the Stars and Stripes brought tears to every eye. On
board, our heads were shaved, we were bathed, clad anew and
were judiciously fed; our old clothes went overboard. After
reaching Annapolis I tipped the scales at seventy-five pounds,
less than half my weight when I enlisted. After a brief stay in
Parole Camp, I was paid off and sent home on a thirty days'
furlough, where I was sick all of the time, but I returned to the
camp at the end of the time to be furloughed again, this time for
sixty days. On getting back to camp the second time, and wearying
of it, I put my name down among those to be returned to
their regiments and I reached mine the day after Lee surrendered.</p></div>

    <h2>REGIMENTAL VETERAN ASSOCIATION</h2>
</div>


<p>The beginnings of the Association seem to have been
lost in the interval between 1867 and the present; it is
agreed, however, that the first four meetings were held in
Boston hotels and that they were not very largely attended.
The time was too near the date of getting home and the
pleasures of that supreme event far outweighed any
rehearsal of common dangers in war-experiences. Of the
5th gathering, the first basket picnic of the veterans of
the Thirty-ninth and their lady friends, there is in substance
the following account:</p>

<p>Downer's Landing, Hingham, was the place and Thursday,
August 17th, the date; the party, numbering 300,
left Litchfield's Wharf at 9.15 a. m. on steamers "Wm.
Harrison" and "Emeline," arriving about 11 o'clock;
a half mile walk brought all parties to the "Melville
Gardens" which had been hired for the day. Noon saw
the tables spread with the many good things brought by
the members. Before repairing to the hall for dancing,
Colonel C. H. Porter, President of the Association, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>troduced
as speakers, Lieut. Colonel Hutchins, Major
Graham, Captain Brigham, Lieuts. Mulligan and Mills,
Sergeants Eames and Gardner. At 3 p. m. came a dress
parade with one hundred and fifty men in line, Colonels
Porter and Hutchins dividing the honors of commanding.
A letter was read from General G. K. Warren, regretting
his inability to be present, a disappointment to the veterans,
as they had expected to meet their former commander
once more; everyone of the Regiment and, for that matter,
every regiment in the Fifth Corps, holding the officer in the
highest esteem. On the formation of the line and led by
Edmunds Band, the company marched back to the landing,
reaching Boston at 5.15 o'clock, all happy and conscious
that the presence of the ladies had added no little to the
enjoyment of the day.</p>

<p>The reunions of 1872, '73 and '74 were held in Boston
Hotels; in 1875, Oct. 6th in Woburn was held the most
notable of the Association's gatherings thus far, General
Warren being the distinguished guest and Company K,
along with citizens of Woburn, the hosts. There were
present 166 men with General Peirson at their head;
drum corps and brass bands furnished music and everyone
joined heartily in the reception to the eminent soldier. At
the rooms of the selectmen, the public had a chance to
meet General Warren. At the armory the meeting was
called to order by Captain Hutchins and the chief feature
was the presentation to General Warren of a magnificent
Maltese Cross in Gold, the badge of the Fifth Corps, the
cost $100.00 having been met by the veterans. In the
afternoon a banquet was served in Lyceum Hall to more
than four hundred guests, the good people of the town
having vied with each other in making the occasion memorable.
At the post prandial exercises, remarks were made by
Captains Hutchins and Tidd; there was an extended
address by J. A. Harvey, Co. C, followed by the introduction
of Sergt. Abijah Thompson, Co. K, as Toastmaster,
who read an original poem after which, and the playing by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
the band of "Hail to the Chief," General Warren spoke
briefly to the following effect, "I rise to acknowledge the
kind attentions I have received to-day. Those who have
spoken have referred in such kind terms to me, and your
marks of approbation have been so many that I do not feel
prepared to speak for the Fifth Army Corps, as I could
wish. I hope you will excuse me. I shall carry from this
place a sense of having been honored more than I deserve.
(Cries of no, no.) The feelings which this day has inspired
will always remain, and you have laid on me a debt of
gratitude I never can repay." Col. C. H. Porter responded
for General Peirson, letters were read from General J.
C. Robinson, and Colonels Farnham and Tilden of the
Sixteenth Maine; further responses to toasts were given by
Maj. Ambrose Bancroft of the Thirty-second Regiment,
Capt. J. P. Crane of the Twenty-second, Capt. C. S. Converse
of the Fifth, Lieut. John L. Parker of the Eleventh
and others, the exercises terminating in an evening's levee
which lasted till midnight.</p>

<p class="mb2">The Centennial year, 1876, found the veterans 150
strong in Natick, the guests of Co. I.; 1877, August 28th,
Co. D of Quincy did the hospitable act with 220 comrades
present. In 1878, Co. E of Somerville, on the 6th of Sept,
helped celebrate the 16th anniversary of the departure of
the Regiment with 225 veterans in attendance, the event
gaining unwonted interest through the presence of General
John C. Robinson who had been the Division Commander
of the Regiment at the Wilderness and at Spottsylvania,
losing there a leg; there was a spirited address by Mayor
Bruce of Somerville, an extended historical paper by Col.
C. H. Porter with speeches of greater or less length by Gov.
A. H. Rice, Gen'l N. P. Banks, Collector Beard, Secretary
Pierce, Speaker Long, General Peirson and others, the
celebration continuing with music and dancing till after
midnight. A pleasant feature of the afternoon was the
presentation of an elegant punch bowl and ladle to General
Robinson by Lieut. C. K. Conn to whose words the General
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>responded so happily that all recognized him as a good
talker as well as fighter.</p>

<p class="mt2">August 27th, 1879, found the survivors of the Thirty-ninth
in Taunton, guests of Co. F with Capt. J. J. Cooper
president of the day and 125 veterans on hand; Adjutant
O. A. Barker welcomed the old soldiers to the city and after
a short business meeting, line was formed for the Agricultural
Fair Grounds where Hiram Maxfield of Silver Springs
fame served one of his imitable clambakes. In 1880,
Sept. 15th, Medford was the entertaining place with
Co. C at the front, Jas. A. Harvey being President. Oct.
5th, '81, the "old boys" came back to Woburn again, the
reception being in the hands of the following named men
of Company K., C. K. Conn., Geo. E. Fowle, Capt. L. R.
Tidd, A. L. Richardson, J. F. Ramsdell, A. P. Barrett, J.
Fred Leslie, A. Thompson and A. R. Linscott. Again
Woburn has the honor of entertaining General G. K.
Warren and he is accompanied by General J. C. Robinson,
the valiant Division Commander, along with General
Peirson, the ever popular regimental commander. At
the dinner which was served in Lyceum Hall, remarks were
made by those named above, Col. Porter and others. Before
another reunion, General Warren will have passed away.</p>

<p>The regimental line formed again in Natick, Oct. 10,
1882; again Co. I plays the role of entertainers with fully
150 survivors to honor the occasion. Dinner was served
in Concert Hall; Col. C. H. Porter spoke at length in praise
of General Warren who had died the 8th day of the preceding
August; resolutions of sympathy and respect
were passed by the veterans and a contribution was made
to a Fifth Corps fund to honor the General's memory.
Remarks followed by Comrades Barrett, "K"; Beck, "C";
Locke, "E"; Eames, "C"; Oliver, "E," and others. 1883
brought the veterans to Quincy again with Co. D. Point
Shirley in Winthrop was the place of meeting, August 26,
1884, with Co. H as entertainers. Roxbury, the home of
Co. B, entertained next, Sept. 23, 1885. Company G came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
to the front Sept. 16, 1886, at Nantasket. The ladies of
Somerville, in behalf of Co. E, furnish the dinner for the
reunion of 1887, Sept. 6th. Through the selection of the
Executive Committee, Bass Point was the place of meeting
in 1888. Sept. 11, 1889, brought the clans to Medford,
once more, with Co. C.</p>

<p>Sept. 24, 1890, the beginning of another decade, brings
the veterans to Woburn, the home of Co. K, for the third
time. As usual, great preparations were made for the
reception, the principal guests, aside from the veterans
themselves, being the widow and daughter of General
Warren, and General Peirson and wife who with the wife of
Mayor Johnson and the wife of the Hon. John Cummings
formed the receiving line in the hall of the Y. M. C. A.
The formalities of the occasion were conducted by Colonel
C. H. Porter and Sergeant Abijah Thompson, "K," and
166 survivors pressed forward, glad of the opportunity of
grasping the hands of their friends. Dinner was served
in Lyceum Hall. The after-dinner exercises were presided
over most happily by Sergt. Thompson who introduced
Mayor Johnson, General Peirson, the Hon. John Cummings,
Colonel Porter and others. Company A was the host
Sept. 7, 1891, at the old Lynnfield camping-ground, and
the occasion was rendered notable by the following paper,
prepared for the day by Lieut. Elbridge Bradshaw of Co. H:</p>


<p class="center">A VACATION IDYL</p>

<div class="blockquot">
    <p>Some thirty years ago, leading a sedentary life and gradually
    sinking into a semi-bituminated condition, my medical adviser,
    alarmed at my symptoms, ordered travel and change of scenery.
    Having learned that Virginia contained more travel and scenery
    to the square mile than any other spot on the globe, I determined
    on visiting that State. Being of a timid nature and fond of Company,
    I joined myself to about a thousand other invalids, similarly
    afflicted, and seeking the same remedy, forming ourselves into a
    methodical organization. For convenience we divided ourselves
    up into groups of one hundred men each, using for purposes of
    distinction the first eleven letters of the alphabet, omitting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
    letter J. For menial service, i. e. to look after our physical wants,
    each group hired for such purpose, six servants, viz. a captain,
    two lieutenants, with a cook, a drummer and a bugler or fifer, the
    latter two being hired to wake the excursionists in the morning.
    To keep these captains and lieutenants in order, we placed over
    them a colonel, a lieut. colonel and a major, at the same time
    they being our head servants or butlers. These people added
    to themselves an adjutant to run errands, a chaplain, a doctor
    and a pill-driver. To insure a faithful discharge of duty, from
    each group were chosen a dozen fellows called sergeants and
    corporals who were set over the others.</p>

    <p>Virginia at this time being in a tumultuous condition, and the
    U. S. Government having heard of our organization's plan of
    travel and objective points, invited us, through its Chief Magistrate,
    to walk over Virginia as peace officers, punching the heads
    of belligerants and arguing with the discontented, an invitation
    which we accepted. When President Lincoln secured our services
    he loaded us with benefits, first massing us at Lynnfield,
    giving us canvass houses to protect us from the dew and damp,
    sweet straw to nestle in, a pretty blue uniform, a belt to keep us
    from bursting, an iron toothpick, a tube of iron with a wooden
    handle, a little black bureau, in which to keep our collars, cuffs
    and bric-a-brac, a black cotton pantry for provisions and plates,
    with a round tin vessel for whiskey. Uncle Sam also gave our
    servants (the shoulder-strapped ones) toasting forks to stick
    pigs with and red sashes with which to gird their persons when
    running and chasing the pigs down. Rendered proud and
    arrogant by their good clothes and shoulder straps, our servants
    rose on us and captured our organization, styling themselves our
    superior officers, and our entire body the Thirty-ninth Regiment
    of Massachusetts Volunteers. To give the usurpation a flavor of
    legality, they procured from Governor Andrew commissions
    indicating officially their rank and authority. On the whole they
    exercised their powers with great moderation and kindness.</p>

    <p>Though to the last, we suffered them to think themselves our
    superiors, yet in reality, they still continued to be our servants,
    caring for our food, clothing and morals, furnishing us clean,
    airy lodgings having adequate fire-escapes, so that in fact we had
    nothing on our minds worth mentioning and all we had to do was to
    travel and fight; in a word, take our pleasure. They also taught
    us many pretty and amusing tricks; how to stand up straight in
    rows to be shot at; to abstain from whiskey (with quinine in it);
    to use the pickaxe and spade with the least expenditure of
    muscular energy and, in mud and night marches, to say our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
    prayers without even stopping. As soon as we could march
    without scalping each other's heels, we left Lynnfield for active
    service and mighty active it proved on the start, our first engagement
    being a footrace against time through Boston. We
    left Lynnfield with cooked rations, meaning saltpork and hardtack.</p>

    <p>Travelling the next three years through Virginia and its
    environments, we were often obstructed by mud and other
    earthern impediments, and the scenery was much disfigured and
    frequently obliterated by sulphurous clouds of smoke, hence
    excursioning for health and pleasure was, on the whole, a failure.
    Speaking for myself, individually, the climate didn't agree with
    me a bit. This I attribute largely to the horizontal metallic
    showers with which that region was infested and against which
    no ordinary cotton umbrella was an adequate protection. Indeed
    the atmosphere was so impregnated with little pellets of
    lead and ragged chunks of cast iron, that my system must have
    absorbed about fifty-five pounds of old junk and brought it
    home with me for, on my return, I weighed 190 lbs. against
    135 when I left Lynnfield.</p>

<p>Natick with its Company I entertained for the third time,
October 5, 1892; Quincy and Co. D did the hospitable
act, also for the third time, in 1893, August 30; Roxbury
and Company B were the entertainers in 1894 and Co. H of
Dorchester received at the U. S. Hotel, Boston, Sept. 25,
1895; for 1896, no record is found, but Sept. 6, 1897, Co. E
and Somerville appear again; it is Medford and Co. C in
1898; Woburn and her K Company in 1899. The old
century ends, as far as our Regiment is concerned, October
10, 1900, with I Company and Natick, while the new
one begins Sept. 7, 1901, on the old campground at Lynnfield;
Sept. 22, 1902, finds the veterans again in Quincy;
Sept. 24, 1903, in Roxbury; August 19, 1904, with Co. H. at
Nantasket. Then with no special company distinctions
the reunions follow, directed by the Executive Committee,
at Squantum Inn, Sept. 21, 1905; Bass Point, Sept. 6, 1906;
in a Dorchester hotel, October 23, 1907; again at Bass
Point, Sept. 29, 1908; at Revere Beach for three successive
years, viz. August 30, 1909, August 18, 1910, and August
18, 1911. Fifty years after the departure of the Regiment
from Massachusetts, nearly a hundred (92) veterans
assembled again in Somerville with Company E and a large
number of prominent citizens to celebrate the semi-centennial;
the state armory was the gathering place and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
General Peirson was the marked figure on the occasion
while wives, daughters and other lady friends added to
the pleasures of the hour; Sergt. Abijah Thompson of Co. K
was the oldest man present, he having seen fully 90 years.
After the dinner, over which Comrade the Rev. John
F. Locke said grace and at which Lieut. J. H. Dusseault,
Co. E, presided, there was speaking by Ex-Mayors Edward
Glines, C. A. Grimmons and John M. Woods, the latter a
veteran of the war, and the first named a brother of Fred
Glines of Co. E who died in Salisbury. Mayor Burns of
Somerville extended the courtesies of the city to the
veterans and welcomed them all most heartily. General
Peirson was received with accustomed enthusiasm and
was heard with rapt attention. The half century event
was a great success. The 51st anniversary was observed in
Medford, with the survivors of Co. C, Sept. 6, 1913; the
day, the place, the guests, quite one hundred in numbers,
made the event notable; the forenoon's meeting was in
the hall of the S. C. Lawrence Post, G. A. R., while the
dinner was served in the drill-room of the magnificent
armory, presented to Medford and the State by General
S. C. Lawrence.</p>

    <h2>REGIMENTAL ROSTER</h2>
</div>


<p>Nothing in the story of a regiment is of greater importance
than its Roster, for therein appears the record of the
individual whether the same be good or bad. One man
alone makes a small appearance, yet a thousand men make
a regiment and every volunteer, whether commissioned
or enlisted, is entitled to the best that can be said of him.
If, in addition to his military service, his career in civil
life may be given in outline so much the better, for in
America every able bodied man is potentially a soldier.
The foundation for the following Roster is found upon the
muster rolls, carefully preserved in the State House,
Boston, and additions have been made thereto through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
the information afforded by members of the Veteran
Association.</p>

<p>The careful reader will observe in scanning the data
afforded by the Roster that the ages of the soldiers almost
entirely range between those of eighteen and forty-five
years, these being the respective limits of legal enlistment;
at the same time everyone is well aware that a large part
of the army was made up of boys in their early teens; also
we know full well that many a man went in long after
reaching the maximum age for military service. As a
fact, then, very many men lied their ages up or down; so
far as the grand average, however, is concerned the "over"
age compensated for or offset those who were "under."
Since the muster-in rolls or enlistment papers are sources
of all data concerning the age of volunteer and, it being
well known that very many of them were and are incorrect,
the wonder rises as to the source of statements that
have gone the rounds of the public press in late years,
wherein the ages represented by the soldiers are carefully
tabulated. However, from whatever source obtained, as
worthy of presentation here the following alleged facts are
given:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Discussion has elicited an official statement that about 2,800,000
Union men enlisted; there were about 5,000,000 men called
out on both sides. Of these nearly 4,500,000 were under twenty-one;
there were about 332,000 who were under sixteen and there
were 1,500 in the Union Army who were not fifteen years old.
Less attention has been given to the men who were over age, but
every regiment can give its cases of men fifty, sixty and even
seventy years of age whose great excess would average up many
a juvenile volunteer. When, however, the rolls afford no such
statements, where is the statistician acquiring his alleged facts?</p></div>

<p>For the sake of brevity and economy of space the following
abbreviations are used:</p>

<p>A. A. G. = Assistant Adjutant General; b. = born; bur. =
buried; bvt. = brevet; batt. = battalion; Capt. = Captain;
Co. = Company; Col. = Colonel; com. = commission or committee;
Corp. = Corporal; cr. = credited; d. = died or dead;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
des. = deserted; det. Serv. = detached Service; dis. = discharged;
disa. = disability; en. = enlisted; ex. of s. = expiration
of service; F. &amp; S. = Field and Staff; G. O. = General
Order; H. Arty. = Heavy Artillery; Infty. = Infantry; k. = killed;
lat. add. = latest address; Lt. or Lieut. = Lieutenant;
M. = married; M. I. = Mustered-in; M. O. = Mustered-out;
mos. = months; mus. = musician; M. V. M. = Mass. Vol.
Militia; N. F. R. = no further record; N. G. = National
Guard; O. W. D. = Order, War Department; Pris. = Prisoner;
prom. = promoted; re-en. = re-enlisted; rep. = reported;
res. = resigned; S. = single; S. H. = Soldiers' Home; S. S. =
sharpshooters; S. O. = Special Order; Sergt. = Sergeant;
trans. = transferred; U. S. C. T. = U. S. Colored Troops;
V. R. C. = Veteran Reserve Corps; w. = widower; wd. =
wounded; W. D. = War Department.</p>

<p>In reciting facts pertaining to each name, the same order
obtains throughout the Roster; first comes the family
name of the soldier, next his Christian appellation; in some
instances time and place of birth are given; as a rule, age,
whether married or single, occupation and place of residence
follow in order; next, date of enlistment or muster-in;
incidents of army life are next in place, and then the time
and manner of leaving the army; finally are given incidents
of civil life and latest address if the same be known. The
application of abbreviations and the order are seen in the
following supposed case:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Jones, John, 20, S.; shoemaker, Natick; Aug. 22, '62; wd.
May 5, '64, Wilderness; dis. disa., Aug. 20, '64;
Selectman, Natick, 1880, '81; 1913, Natick.</p></div>

<p>Printed in full the foregoing would be as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Jones, John, at the age of twenty years, single, a shoemaker
living in Natick, enlisted August 22, 1862, or
was mustered in on that date; he was wounded in the
battle of the Wilderness and, on account of wounds
or disability therefrom, was discharged August 20,
1864; he was a Selectman in Natick in 1880 and '81
and in 1913 is still residing there.</p></div>

    <h2>FIELD AND STAFF<br />
    COLONELS</h2>
</div>


<div class="blockquot">

    <p>P. Stearns Davis, 44, M.; stationer, Cambridge; August
    29, 1862; Phineas Stearns Davis was born in Brookline,
    June 23, 1818, his Christian names coming to him
    from an ancestor who bore a part in the Boston Tea
    Party; his earlier education, received in the Brookline
    public schools, was supplemented by a journey around
    the world; in the publishing of schoolbooks he was
    long associated with his brother, Robert, on Washington
    Street, Boston; deeply interested in Free
    Masonry, Colonel Davis had been Master of Putnam
    Lodge, Cambridge, was a member of St. Paul Chapter,
    Royal Arch, and was a charter member of St. Bernard's
    Commandery, Knights Templar of Boston;
    entering the Militia at a very early age, the beginning
    of the War found him Division Inspector on the Staff
    of General Samuel Andrews of the First Division;
    later promoted to the rank of Brigadier General, he
    was serving in 1862 on a Board of Examination,
    thereby rendering signal aid to Governor Andrew; he
    passed thence to the Thirty-ninth Regiment. On
    leaving his home, he said to his mother who had
    expressed wonder, if not regret, at his going, "Mother,
    if I should live to see the end of this war without
    going and doing my whole duty to my country, I
    should never rest," and he went away with her
    blessing. Perhaps no man throughout the strife
    entered the service with higher motives than those
    which prompted Colonel Davis. Possessing as high
    an ideal of discipline and drill as he had of morality
    and patriotism, he proceeded to enforce them with
    the result that few if any organizations in the volunteer
    service excelled the Thirty-ninth in true soldierly
    qualities. Early called to the command of a brigade,
    it was truly said of him that he never was assigned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
    to any position which he did not fill. The particulars
    of his death, July 11, 1864, have appeared in the body
    of this book; his funeral, held with Masonic honors in
    the Unitarian Church of Cambridge, was on July 18,
    the entire city being in mourning, with all places of
    business closed; flags were at half-mast and in the
    audience assembled to honor his memory were the
    City Council of Cambridge, Governor Andrew and
    Staff, Adjutant General Schouler, Mayor Lincoln of
    Boston and a wide range of other civil and military
    officers; Free Masonry in which he was so prominent
    was represented by Putnam Lodge to which he
    belonged, officers of the Grand Lodge, St. Bernard's
    Encampment of Boston, and the National Lancers
    also were present. Speakers at the services were the
    Rev. Chandler Robbins, who had officiated at his
    marriage, and Chaplain E. B. French who had accompanied
    the remains of his commander home. With the
    long escort, the body of Colonel Davis was borne to
    Mt. Auburn Cemetery, having as bearers General
    Samuel C. Lawrence, Colonels C. L. Holbrook and
    L. B. Marsh, Postmaster Leighton and Deputy
    Sheriff L. L. Parker, the burial being with Masonic
    rites.</p>

    <p>Charles L. Peirson, from Lieut. Colonel July 13, 1864;
    owing to the stress of the "Battle Summer" campaign,
    his severe wound at the Weldon R. R. August 18, '64,
    and subsequent absence from the Regiment, not to
    mention the red tape that ever did hedge military
    matters about, it was not till the 23d of November,
    1864, that Colonel Peirson was mustered in to his
    rank: the Records of the War Department, Washington,
    D. C., state:</p>

    <div class="blockquot">

        <p>Peirson is now held and considered by this Department, under
        the provisions of the Act of Congress, approved February 24,
        1897, to have been mustered into the service of the United States
        in the grade of Colonel, Thirty-ninth Massachusetts Infantry,
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>to take effect from July 13, 1864, and to have held that rank
        until the date of his discharge from service.</p>

        <p>Upon the recommendation of Major General G. K. Warren,
        Peirson was commissioned Colonel of Volunteers by brevet, to
        date from March 13, 1865, for meritorious conduct in the battles
        of the Wilderness and Spottsylvania in May, 1864, and as Brigadier
        General of Volunteers, by brevet, to date from March 13,
        1865, for gallant and meritorious conduct in the battle of the
        Weldon Railroad in August, 1864.</p>

        <p>After months of prostration, incident to his wound, and
        on the clear evidence of his inability to return to the
        Regiment, Colonel Peirson resigned and was mustered
        out of the service January 11, 1865. Subsequent
        to the war, General Peirson was long in the iron
        business, Boston; on his retirement therefrom, he
        found occupation for his well earned leisure in historical
        studies, particularly with reference to the
        Civil War, being a member of the Loyal Legion, which
        he commanded, 1895, and the Massachusetts Military
        Historical Society. His city residence is at 191 Commonwealth
        Avenue; his summer abode is at Pride's
        Crossing, city of Beverly.</p>

    a Corporal in the Fourth Battalion, under Major
    T. G. Stevenson, which in the spring of 1861 did
    gratuitous service in Fort Warren, Boston Harbor;
    later commissioned First Lieut. and Adjutant in the
    Twentieth Massachusetts, he was taken prisoner at the
    Battle of Ball's Bluff and suffered three months'

    at his home in Boston, June 6th following, the very
    day of the return of the Thirty-ninth. The six weeks
    immediately following the battle were spent in the
    hospital at City Point; thence he returned to Boston,
    getting there May 9th, apparently on the road to
    recovery, but the setting in of intermittent fever
    proved to be too great a trial of his strength; his
    body was buried in Forest Hills Cemetery. Of him
    a writer in a Boston paper wrote at the time:&mdash;</p>

    <div class="blockquot">
        <p>His standard of manliness was one of noble action rather than

<p>William Thorndike, 29, M.; surgeon, Beverly; Nov. 17,
1863; an A. B. from Harvard, 1854, he also gained
there his M. D., 1857; had seen service as Ass't Surgeon,
Thirty-fourth Massachusetts Volunteers, whence
he came to the Thirty-ninth; his efficiency in the Regiment
was thoroughly appreciated by the men, and
General Peirson affirms that recovery from the wound
received at the Weldon R. R. was the result of the
care and attention of his surgeon; the son of the
latter, William, Jr., also Harvard, 1892, and M. D.,
1896, is a Boston practitioner, whose wife is a daughter
of the late General William Tecumseh Sherman;
Surgeon Thorndike died in 1887.</p></div>

of the Wilderness the Chaplain was right up at the
front with the boys and when Daniel Burnham of our
Company was shot and about to die, the Chaplain
took his last message and whatever he had to send to his
wife and family and comforted him in his last few
moments of life; he accompanied the remains of
Colonel Davis from Petersburg to Cambridge and
spoke at the funeral; M. O. June 2, 1865; he was born
in Lowell, Nov. 20, 1832; his earlier years were spent
in Holliston; his first pastorate was in Chatham,
whence he was the first man to enlist in the Thirty-ninth;
after the war he served pastorates in Babylon,
L. I., and Perth Amboy, N. J., but his health, enfeebled
by exposures at the front, broke and recovery
was sought in Texas and Wisconsin, but without
avail. He died July 14, 1907, in Harwich with relatives
of his wife, who had preceded him to the other
world, and his body was laid by the side of hers in the
Harwich burial ground."</p></div>

<p>Emory Washburn, Jr., 24, &mdash;; lawyer, Cambridge; Aug.
25, '62; the son of Ex-Governor Emory Washburn, he
was born in Worcester, Oct. 1, 1837; graduating from
Harvard College in 1860, he had just taken his degree
of LL. B. in 1862 when he was commissioned in the
new regiment then forming; evidently his direct service,
if any, in the Thirty-ninth was brief, for on the
first Monthly Report he appears as detached and
a member of the staff of General Charles Devens, also
a Worcester man; in this capacity he did excellent
work, as appears in the report of General Devens,
after the battle of Fredericksburg, written Dec. 17,
'62, wherein he says, "I am under especial obligations,
for their zeal and fidelity, to my staff," including with
two others, "my aide, Lieut. E. Washburn, Jr." It
would appear that Adjutant Washburn returned to
the Regiment for one week at Poolesville, Md.,

Legion, Captain Porter was conspicuous in promoting
its interests; was Junior Vice-Commander, 1897;
Registrar, 1903-5; Recorder, 1906-11; no veteran of
the Regiment took more interest in its annual reunions
than did Captain Porter, and for years he was practically
its motive power. His papers on the campaigns
in which he bore a part were valuable contributions
to the Massachusetts Military Historical Society.

to the Oregon while she was building in San Francisco,

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>The Day of Roses and wreaths, of Laurel and
leaves of love and honor and happy memories,
not of sorrow or sadness or regrets. No colors
half-mast for them. Glory throws the banner to
the breeze. All hail, dear Comrades! You left
us with a smile; we will join you with the same
expression, and meanwhile will keep a festival
for you and call it Memorial Day. You won in
the last charge. Duty triumphed. You were
given that firm faith that knows no fear. Living
or dying, you cared not which, you offered your
all for the Cause. The Cause was the succor of
your country. You saved it. We will protect it,
and with the blessing of God upon us both, we will
hand it down as a home for the world to envy,
and to occupy.&mdash;C. L. Peirson.</em></p></div>

not thought of by the commissary in his wildest dream, was accorded in the
Thirty-ninth Regiment to Gilbert and Sumner Pullen, both natives of the
State of Maine and enjoying the kinship of Second Cousins. After the war,
Sumner Pullen, whose home was in Dedham, was a travelling salesman
throughout his business life. He died in Dedham, Sept., 1890, aged 79 years;
of Gilbert Pullen, no data subsequent to the war have been found.</p></div>

and Massachusetts, shows that Colonel Davis was commissioned August 29,
1862, and Colonel Jewett on the 26th, though the document was not issued
until the 30th. Since possession is universally considered nine points of law,
it would seem that the burden of evidence was on the side of the Massachusetts
Colonel.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_E_5" id="Footnote_E_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_E_5"><span class="label">[E]</span></a> It was during this strenuous night that General Briggs imparted to the
Thirty-ninth men near him, acting as bodyguard, the interesting item that
an old farmhouse near them was the very one in which "Old John Brown,"
in October, 1859, had assembled his followers and whence, during the night of
the 17th, they went to the attack on Harper's Ferry. As the Kennedy farm,
the place of rendezvous, was within sight of Boonsboro, it is not improbable
that the morning's halt was near the historic building.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_F_6" id="Footnote_F_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_F_6"><span class="label">[F]</span></a> John C. Robinson, one of the famous officers of the Union Army, was born
in Binghamton, N. Y., April 10, 1817, left West Point 1838, a year before
graduation, to study law, but returned to the army in 1839; he won distinction
in the Mexican War; as Commandant of Fort McHenry, Baltimore, at
the breaking out of the War, he preserved it for the Union side; from the
Colonelcy of the First Michigan Infantry, he rose steadily in rank to the
command of a division; he was prominent through the Seven Days' Fight, was
ever in evidence from Fredericksburg to Gettysburg; he lost a leg at Spottsylvania
thus retiring from service in the field; with Governor General John
A. Dix, he was Lieut. Governor of the Empire State in 1873-4 and was commander-in-chief
of the Grand Army of the Republic in 1877-8; in 1887 he
attended annual reunion of the Thirty-ninth; he died February 18, 1897.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_G_7" id="Footnote_G_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_G_7"><span class="label">[G]</span></a> The wounding of Private Dow was the first bloodshed in the Regiment,
and in token thereof he was promoted to be a corporal. As this was the only
casualty in the Regiment, during the Mine Run campaign, the death which
Col. T. W. Higginson gives in his story of Massachusetts in the Army and Navy
1861-65 must be an error.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_H_8" id="Footnote_H_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_H_8"><span class="label">[H]</span></a> Long years intervening, General Peirson recalls the existence of a certain
church edifice, out Slaughter Mountain way, which in a former campaign had
afforded cover for a rebel battery and that the same, issuing from its concealment,
had done no little harm to the Second Massachusetts Infantry, even
wounding several of his good friends. Lest it might be used thus again, and
with a certain feeling of resentment as though the building had been <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">particeps
criminis</i>, he suggested to the builders of the winter quarters that the siding
of the house and its foundations might help out their own building schemes.
"A word to the wise" was sufficient, and ere long the structure disappeared, to
reappear as flooring and chimneys for Yankee comfort. The story does not
end here, since many years later the officer was introduced, at the home of a
Boston friend, to a Virginian lady whose mission North was the soliciting of
funds for the rebuilding of the very edifice whose destruction he had suggested.
The General's memory seemed defective when asked whether he responded
liberally or not.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_I_9" id="Footnote_I_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_I_9"><span class="label">[I]</span></a> John Newton, like Winfield Scott and George H. Thomas, was a native of
Virginia, and was appointed thence to West Point, where he was graduated
in 1842, No. 2, in a class that included Rosecrans, Pope, Seth Williams,
Doubleday, Sykes and other noted Federal leaders and Longstreet, D. H.
Hill, Gustavus W. Smith, McLaws and Van Dorn of the Confederates. In
continuous service in the Engineer Corps, he had attained the rank of captain
when the war began. He was assistant engineer in the construction of the
defenses of Washington; served through the Peninsular campaign; was at
Antietam, Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville and at Gettysburg and followed
Reynolds as commander of the First Corps. After leaving the Army of the
Potomac, he commanded a division in the Fourth Corps, under O. O. Howard,
in the army of the Cumberland having a part in the campaign which culminated
in the capture of Atlanta, September 1864. Later he commanded various
districts in Florida until his muster-out from the volunteer service, January
1866. His subsequent life was devoted to engineering, among his most notable
deeds being the removal of obstructions in Hell Gate, the narrow passage of
East River, between Long Island Sound and New York Harbor. Subsequent
to his resignation from the army in 1884, he became Commissioner of Public
Works in New York City; at the time of his death in his seventy-second year,
May 1, 1895, he was president of the Panama Railroad and of the Panama and
Columbian Steamship Companies.</p></div>

"Robinson, who brought up the rear of the corps, camped on the Germanna
Road, the middle of his division about where Caton's Run comes down through
the woods from the west." P. 97</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_K_11" id="Footnote_K_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_K_11"><span class="label">[K]</span></a> Greeley in "The American Conflict" says, "Thousands of the unnamed and
unknown have evinced as fervid and as pure a patriotism, but no one surrendered
more for his country's sake, or gave his life more joyfully for her deliverance,
than did James S. Wadsworth."</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_L_12" id="Footnote_L_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_L_12"><span class="label">[L]</span></a> In General Schaff's "Wilderness" we may read, "The victorious Confederates
could not pursue beyond the guns, or even stand there, for Sweitzer's
of Griffin's, and the First Brigade of Robinson's division, under my friend,
Charles L. Peirson, a gentleman, together with our rallied men, now poured
such a fire into them from the east side of the field, that they fled back to their
lines on the edge of the woods.... In an effort to recapture the guns&mdash;whose
loss, Griffin, the commander of our West Point battery in my day, felt deeply&mdash;the
Ninth Massachusetts and the Ninetieth Pennsylvania suffered frightfully,
adding to the thickly lying dead in the old field." (Page 163.)</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_M_13" id="Footnote_M_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_M_13"><span class="label">[M]</span></a> James Clay Rice was born in Worthington, Mass., December 27, 1829,
and was graduated from Yale in 1854; after a period spent in teaching in
Natchez, Miss., he came to New York, studied law, began its practice in 1856,
and thus the war found him. He enlisted as a private in the Thirty-ninth
(Garabaldi Guards) New York Infantry, was soon commissioned First Lieutenant,
and Adjutant, and as a Captain, was present at Bull Run. On the organization
of the Forty-fourth New York, or the Ellsworth Avengers, he was made
Lieutenant Colonel, later Colonel, and saw all of the active service of that regiment,
winning distinction at Gettysburg. At the time of his death he was in
command of the Second Brigade, Fourth (Wadsworth's) Division of the Fifth
Corps. Like Sedgwick, he was shot by a sharpshooter. His last words were,
"Turn me over towards the enemy; let me die with my face to the foe."</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_N_14" id="Footnote_N_14"></a><a href="#FNanchor_N_14"><span class="label">[N]</span></a> It is claimed that the body of Colonel Davis was carried from the field by
Corp. S. H. Mitchell, "A"; Corp. B. F. Prescott and W. S. Sumner, both of
"H"; and Sergt. L. A. Spooner of Company I.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_O_15" id="Footnote_O_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_O_15"><span class="label">[O]</span></a> November 14, 1911, when visiting the Robert E. Lee Home for Confederate
Veterans in Richmond, John Maxwell, an ex-confederate, whose
later days were passing in this congenial harborage, was introduced and
requested to tell the Northern visitors how he blew up the Yankees. Nothing
loth, the veteran in gray, holding in his hands the works of an alarm clock,
told the story of his sneaking into the Union lines and, when opportunity
offered, placing his infernal machine, with his time-wheel for explosion properly
set, where it would do the most execution and then hastening away. His
auditors, so recently from the dedication of a Massachusetts monument on
the edge of the Crater, recalling an even greater explosion, were hardly in
position to find any great amount of fault with his act, since "Sauce for the
goose is also sauce for the gander." "Where were you, Johnnie, when the
thing went off?" was a natural question from one of the hearers. "Oh, I was
two miles away, making the best time possible towards the Confederacy."
(Vid. R. R. Serial No. 87. p. 954).</p></div>

men and carried so that the red hot middle might hit a good-sized tree,
the extended iron would be bent almost double. The two ends being somewhat
divergent; four rails thus carried and thus applied and symmetrically
placed about a tree made a very good Maltese Cross, the badge of the Fifth
Corps and other army corps were wont to say when, as at the North Anna,
they saw many tokens of this sort, "Well, the Fifth Corps has been here."

version of the day's incident, stating that when the Union batteries began
to play on our lines, the commander of the color guard sent him back to stop
the firing and in so doing, he ran into the rebel line. At once he tried to hide
behind some bushes but a Johnnie got his eye on him and ordered him to
come out, which he did. Walking along in the ranks, a prisoner, he saw a
reb have a stand of colors and, on account of the rain, they were done up in
their case, which he recognized as one that he had mended, and he also knew
the staff which had been scarred by battle as belonging, both of them, to the
Thirty-ninth. Naturally McFeeley kept as near the colors as possible and
their present holder, who was very happy over his proud possession, though
he had only picked them out of the rut where Adams had thrown them.
When Wheelock's relieving column came charging through, McFeeley stepped
up to the rebel and remarked that he guessed he would hold that same flag
awhile, thus saving the precious token from gracing some Confederate collection
of curios.</p></div>

County, Penn., 1819. Having served seven years in the Militia, President
Polk made him a first lieutenant in the Eleventh U. S. Infantry, when the
Mexican War began. Participating in the principal battles of that strife, he
came home a captain. A lawyer when the Rebellion began, he offered his
services to Gov. Curtin and was made deputy quartermaster general of the
state. When Col. Thos. A. Zeigle of the One Hundred and Seventh Penn.
died July 16, '62, on the vote of the line officers of the Regiment, he was made
colonel. He had a part in all of the varied service of the One Hundred and
Seventh to the end and went home a Brevet Brig. General. General Warren was
particularly warm in his appreciative remarks about the colonel. Going home
to Lewistown, Penn., he resumed the practice of law. Marrying May 22d,
'73, Miss Margaret E. Ross of Harrisburg, he led the life of respect and responsibility,
one of the most prominent citizens of his town, for nearly half a century
a ruling elder in the Presbyterian church and died July 20, 1899. His
son, Frank R., a West Pointer, an officer in the Tenth U. S. Infantry, was
wounded at San Juan, Cuba, and is now a Captain on the General Staff,
Washington. Ancestors of the Colonel were in the Colonial Wars, members
of Morgan's Riflemen in the Revolution; were in the War of 1812, and through
father and son, in every National war since.</p></div>

Some even aver that it was a Confederate institution. General H. L. Abbot,
in his History of the First Connecticut Heavy Artillery, has the following,
"To check an annoying enfilade firing from the left bank of the Appomattox,
a thirteen inch sea coast mortar was mounted on a curve of the Railroad track
by Company G. This novelty was widely known as the 'Petersburg Express.'
The mortar, on a heavy granite foundation, since Sept. 25, 1902, has stood
upon the State House grounds, Hartford, as a memorial to the First Heavies."</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_T_20" id="Footnote_T_20"></a><a href="#FNanchor_T_20"><span class="label">[T]</span></a> Peter Lyle, Colonel of the Ninetieth Pennsylvania, Bvt. Brig. General, and
for much of the service of the Thirty-ninth in the Fifth Corps, commander
of the Brigade, was born in Philadelphia, Christmas Day, 1821. Receiving
very little education from the schools, he was apprenticed to the cigar trade
while yet a boy. His marked boyish predelection was love for military matters,
and he drilled his boyish associates, formed into a company, till they
became noted for their proficiency, accomplishing in their juvenile way
wonders with their broomstick guns. When only sixteen years of age, during
the absence of the officers, he commanded and paraded the City Phalanx.
While still a youth he organized an independent company which he commanded
until it was taken into the National Guards. In 1846 he succeeded
to the command of the company which before the war had increased to a
battalion, becoming a regiment in 1860 under the command of Colonel Lyle.
His organization had volunteered for service in the Mexican War but, the
quota being full, it did not go. At the outbreak of the Rebellion, the Regiment,
as the Nineteenth Pennsylvania, volunteered and so served for three
months. Reorganized in August, 1861, it was sworn in for three years as the
Ninetieth Regiment, still commanded by Colonel Lyle. He never fully
recovered from a wound received at Antietam. Subsequent to the war he was
elected sheriff in 1867, being a Democrat in politics, serving a single term.
Much that he had acquired during his term was absorbed by an agricultural
venture in Maryland which, failing finally, he was thrown entirely upon the
outcome of carriage making, a business to which he gave immediate attention
after the discharge of the Regiment, his associate being his late Adjutant,
David P. Weaver. His last public appearance in a military capacity was
during the riots of 1877 when, though suffering agonies from bodily ills, he
sat his saddle and discharged his duties faithfully. Soon after he declined a
re-election to the command of the Regiment and died in Philadelphia, July 17,
1879. His burial was attended with all the honors due a full Brigadier General,
his body having lain in state in the armory of his Regiment that he had
led so long and so well; it was buried in Ivy Hill Cemetery by the side of his
brother, David M. Lyle, the last Chief Engineer of the Philadelphia Volunteer
Fire Department. For the foregoing facts we are indebted to Captain
P. Lyle Weaver, a son of Adjutant D. P. Weaver, himself a Philadelphia
journalist.&mdash;A. S. R.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_U_21" id="Footnote_U_21"></a><a href="#FNanchor_U_21"><span class="label">[U]</span></a> One of the most pleasant memories of war times is that of the almost David
and Jonathan relations that existed between certain regiments. This was the
case with the Thirty-ninth and the Sixteenth Maine; either one had a feeling
of security if, in the hour of danger, it was supported by the other; exposed
repeatedly to a common peril, in a measure, the history of one is that of both;
each regiment had the highest regard and respect for the leaders of its fellow
organization and for years after the war exchange of courtesies on reunion
occasions was an expected event. Closely related in early history as were
Maine and Massachusetts, the equal intimacy between representatives of the
two states in camp and march and on the field lingers long in the minds of
those who participated.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_W_23" id="Footnote_W_23"></a><a href="#FNanchor_W_23"><span class="label">[W]</span></a> Governour Kemble Warren was born in Cold Spring, Putnam Co., N. Y.,
January 8, 1830, and was graduated from West Point, No. 2, in a class of
forty-four members, very few of whom, however, are known to fame, Cuvier
Grover and Powell T. Wyman being the most noted among his loyal classmates
and Wm. T. Magruder and Robert Ransom among the rebels. Assigned
on graduation to the Topographical Engineers, he was in constant and active
service till his appointment as mathematical instructor at West Point, 1859,
and there the Rebellion found him. At first he was Lieut. Colonel of the Fifth
(Duryea's Zouaves), N. Y. Volunteers, soon succeeding to the colonelcy;
he was the last to leave the field at Big Bethel, remaining to rescue the body of
Lieut. J. T. Greble, the first Regular Army officer to lose his life in the war.
He helped build the forts on Federal Hill, Baltimore. He served in the Peninsular
Campaign, acquiring a brigade in May, '62, and, in the subsequent
months, there was very little doing by the Army of the Potomac in which he
did not bear a conspicuous part. His bronze figure on Little Round Top must
forever tell the story of his watchfulness and alertness at Gettysburg and the
members of the Fifth Army Corps, to a man, never failed to chant his praises.
The incident of his suspension from his command at Five Forks is a blot on
the fame of Sheridan and made Warren's place in the hearts of his followers
warmer than ever. A skillful engineer, he was constantly employed in the army
up to the time of his death, which no doubt was hastened by the unfortunate
occurrence of April, '65. His relations with the Thirty-ninth, after the war,
were of an unusually intimate character. He died in Newport, R. I., August
8, 1882.</p></div>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
